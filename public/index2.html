<p>It may be that somewhere, something learns to read THE INTENDED MEANING held within the varying oscillations and action potential sequences. By "the intended meaning" is meant a 3D story (consciousness) that is changing over time. Similar geometries trigger other similar geometries to create familiarity.</p>
<p>But also, part of this "intended meaning" of story is the drawing of it, which is done by a "printhead" that often assumes the form of a ring (or a 3D cursor point at fine temporal resolution).</p>
<p>So something, somewhere is hearing the barrage of action potentials and oscillations and responding to them as though they were a magical 3D cursor drawing out rings at changing attitudes which, over time, is "drawing" the actual 3D animated full-color consciousness.</p>
<p>Or you could say that the 3D story movie "fits" within the continually growing helix. It may be that this "fit" isn't a logical, meaningful fit, but rather is the "leap of faith" the reader of the signal takes to extract, "yes, it must be this meaning of this beautiful story!" and responds accordingly.</p>
<p>After all, "it" has learned that it is almost always "correct" in interpreting the oscillations in this way, because it always gets feedback by seeing how its actions affect the updated "story," or patterns of temporal oscillations.</p>
<p>Francis Crick, the co-discoverer of DNA and student of consciousness, was said to have one word circled on his chalkboard near his death â€” "meaning." That really does seem to be somehow the mechanism of consciousness.</p>
<p>If we ignore how the brain does it, we can make one final observation: consciousness can be simplified to "fading ink." The printhead, the holder of the printhead (the bank), the flow of past frames, what is getting painted (real world or imagination), sound, inertia are all nice things, but they don't fundamentally change that consciousness is really just the one thing â€” INK, getting applied in a 3D perceptual space.</p>
<p>Consciousness is fading ink, as far as the experience of consciousness. The mechanism of generating consciousness appears to be certain perturbations in oscillations or action potentials over time, which the brain as a whole is to respond to as if it were a 3D cursor moving in rings over time and the zigs and zags of the rings giving the patterning to clue it in to the full 3D story meaning.</p>
<p>So, it may be that the brain never has to paint a single voxel of the story of consciousness, but rather only draws this ring/helix with zig and zags in its path. But even more fundamentally, it doesn't even have to draw this, but rather just provide the zigs and zags (oscillations) and make these zigs and zags such that if they were interpreted as tracing this particular ring, it would be somehow accurate pattern-wise to further interpret the helix as containing the story of consciousness.</p>
<p>It's a sort of "do all the hard work up front, then the task that would have been impossible (drawing consciousness) arises from all the patterns of patterns of patterns you have intentionally built up." Or, stated again, "We as a brain will have unity in how we are drawing consciousness over time, sharing the same ring shape and attitude and angular velocity of the 3D cursor thereof, in any given moment."</p>
<p>The story (consciousness 3D movie) would be "hallucinated" (but rightly so) into existence as "fitting" within the growing helix, even though the "fit" is by "learned association," not by any logical or geometrical "fit." The hallucination is strengthened because adjusting the patterns "moves" the "avatar" of you within the story.</p>
<p>If so, I could say that color, one of the hardest aspects of consciousness to understand, has its glossy existence because that is the MEANING the "what path" of the brain is trying to have painted within the story.</p>
<p>Then, nothing would have to actually "paint" the color, as it is understood, not painted. The colors of consciousness, hence, would be no more painted than any other aspect of consciousness, as it is not painted, but understood from temporal patterns. At least that is my best guess as of now.</p>
<p>I have said that I thought color was part of the "where" ("Sensory Physical World") "real world" path, but since Jill Taylor had a stroke on the left side of her brain and temporarily lost color, I think it also (along with nearly all of consciousness), is provided by the left "what" pathway ("Cartoon Motor World" when it models "Sensory Physical World").</p>
<p>So, in this story of consciousness being "drawn" as the "meaning" of temporal oscillations/firings, there is only one rate of the ring that is drawing it. In this sense, consciousness has only one frequency at any given time, but morphs generally from 0.5 Hz to 14 Hz. The oscillations of the brain can do their own thing for their own reasons, but the one unifying meaning is drawn by a single helix, and hence the frequency of this ring (or more precisely, the "angular velocity" of the 3D cursor drawing the ring) is unitary across the brain (though varying over time).</p>
<p>To see the angular velocity of this 3D cursor drawing this helix, you would have to understand the very language that a specific person's brain uses for drawing consciousness. The patterns might be completely different from person to person as it appears to be learned patterns over time. But, there might be clues such as at the hippocampus or thalamus.</p>

<p>I have a fascination for learning the mechanisms behind how things work, whether it's why a flute and oboe playing the same frequency and amplitude note sound so different (read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Physics-Speech-Cambridge-Textbooks-Linguistics/dp/0521293790">The Physics of Speech by D.B. Fry</a> for the explanation), whether it is how magnetism can be said to arise from the looping of an electron around a nucleus (especially when quantum physics says the electron doesn't loop), or whether it is how disparate qualia (cold, color, self) can all arise in the brain. On January 1st of 2022, I took a couple legal hemp gummies that provided me with an amazingly enlightening experience - all the qualia of consciousness could be seen as inertial (their common denominator), because they were all starting and stopping along this sort of perpetual tracing of rings. The rings aren't colored, but are detectable in location "within" the percepted physical world as this sort of invisible thing-out-of-which consciousness grows. It was like I was seeing the most incipient moments of consciousness. Unclothed with normal full-grown features, I could "see" the hidden thing that was drawing 100% of consciousness (or out-of-which consciousness was growing, or off of which consciousness was referencing).</p>

<p>As I took notes from that and six later experiences, I will provide the journals as well: <a href="/rawJournals/trip1.html">Trip 1.</a> <a href="/rawJournals/trip2.html">Trip 2.</a> <a href="/rawJournals/trip3.html">Trip 3.</a> <a href="/rawJournals/trip4.html">Trip 4.</a> <a href="/rawJournals/trip5.html">Trip 5.</a> <a href="/rawJournals/trip6.html">Trip 6.</a> <a href="/rawJournals/trip7.html">Trip 7.</a> <a href="/rawJournals/trip8.html">Trip 8.</a> <a href="/rawJournals/trip9.html">Trip 9.</a> <a href="/rawJournals/trip10.html">Trip 10.</a> <a href="/rawJournals/trip11.html">Trip 11.</a></p>

<h2>Ring Theory Solves the Binding Problem</h2>

<p>This site is actually devoted to one theory of consciousness, but there are multiple proposed components of consciousness, and each may have one or many possible theories of its own. The main theory is that "rings" underlie the feeling of all the qualia (sound, taste, pain, accomplishment, self, and possibly sight) and serve generally as a focal tool. This theory is laid out in the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rings-Fire-Brain-Makes-Consciousness/dp/B0B5RWKQ3Y">"Rings of Fire: How the Brain Makes Consciousness,"</a> by Brad Caldwell. A <a href="https://youtu.be/YFj0Vapvdc4">video</a> explaining the basics is available also. I am convinced that this theory solves the main "binding problem" of how disparate qualia can be unified, as I have experienced it in a profound way, where all the qualia started and stopped together, and I could see how they, seemingly disparate, can arise from inertial feelings.</p>

<p>Not only did I experience rings, I saw the thing that "prints" them. If you imagine that the scenery around you is printed by a giant cube matrix of 3D points, you get an idea. I think the reason I could see the structure of this "bank" is because it was "leaky" and leaking "consciousness ink" out slightly from several of the most oft-used 3D shapes within it. While the bank (shown in image below) is usually two feet cubed, it can readily grow to miles cubed for large scenes. In reality, the "bank" is not this perfect, and incorporates millions of everyday items in the translucent shape/skin collection, not just sphere shells and cube shells. Everything (shape-wise) you've stored is in the bank.</p>

<img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/theoriesofconsciousness.appspot.com/o/bankBig.jpg?alt=media&token=6eb48112-f53a-43fa-87af-388ae6caa799" alt="The Bank an isomorphic collection of 3D and 2D shapes" class="responsive"></img>

<p>This "ring" theory also says that, like a movie, much of what the brain does in creating the seemingly smooth experience of consciousness is actually made with several static or spaced components. In other words, there are frequencies to aspects of consciousness. Focus seems to be a ring varying from 2 Hz to 14 Hz, but the "frames" it uses have "movified" paint on them - the visual colored part is a movie within the short frame - and each frame is joined so perfectly that you get tricked into believing the "movie" is all there is. The "movie" of colors has a higher frequency (100 Hz?) and perhaps the voxels at different spatial locations are randomized in phase for even more smoothness. Someone with Parkinson's may be able to notice these focal frames, as their jerky motions may bewray imperfectly smooth transitions between focal frames.</p>

<img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/theoriesofconsciousness.appspot.com/o/veryLapseSmall.jpg?alt=media&token=29bf11ff-c9f9-4818-a776-31e0010f49de" alt="Frames of consciousness" class="responsive"></img>

<p>There are two basic "worlds" within consciousness. The first is what I call the "Sensory Physical World." If you just look at your visual surroundings (but include your body and the location of sounds you are hearing), that is the "Sensory Physical World" (SPW). It isn't the real world, but it does a very good job of modeling it! That world that seems real to you is merely the handiwork of your brain painting what it thinks the world must be like. The second "world" of consciousness is one you know, but don't know that you know. It is called the "Cartoon Motor World" (CMW), and is basically your focus or imagination. Like the SPW, it is a realm of 3D skins that can move over time (sort of like a 3D movie), but the skins in this world are usually about 1/10th the size, and are translucent (no color). They are also nearly subconscious, and usually more felt than viewed. Nevertheless, they carry the meaning and info of more abstract qualia that cannot be represented by the SPW alone.</p>
<p>When you hear someone begin talking, your CMW springs into action depicting the actions and objects described by the speech, or depicting the person talking. You can't hear something and not start drawing these meaning-depictions in animated 3D translucent skins. If you hit your thumb with a hammer, your CMW will paint a 3D translucent skin movie of you getting your thumb smashed, or it glowing red with pain, and "fly" you against time and provide inertial hits and vibrations that fully depict the feeling of your pain. As long as the back half of the brain paints consciousness clearly enough for the front half ("you") to be able to ascertain the meaning therein, that's all that's needed.</p>
<p>So, this "ring"/"helix" (which perhaps if a later, more grown phase is emphasized, could assume some 3D skin such as spherical, raised-relief-topo, or objectified) can serve not only as the portal between switching brain perception models between SPW and CMW, but as the portal between "presentation" (perceptual model) and contemplation and/or "action" (driving the motor responses). All your movements may be driven at the top level of consciousness by this helix. After all, the top level of consciousness shouldn't have to worry about the intricacies of movement (unless it is learning something new, in which case consciousness is given access to low-level things like precise finger movement) - it should be able to merely "know" what motor plan it wants to implement and have the rest of the brain "read its mind." It can do this if sub-regions work from the bottom up and just present the head of the motor plan to the PFC as an abstract thing, and if every region of the brain has to use the ring/helix as a unifying, spatial and temporal reference. If you focus in on one instantaneous moment, then an infinitesimal phasic distance on the helix is merely a point somewhere in perceptual space. The "ring" or "helix" becomes a "3D cursor" at the right level of temporal zooming in.</p>

<img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/theoriesofconsciousness.appspot.com/o/AGUsRingCMWSPW.jpg?alt=media&token=7ba2d14d-579d-4b1a-b248-a287785536f7" alt="Sensory Physical World and Cartoon Motor World and Rings" class="responsive"></img>

<p>Perhaps both worlds (SPW, CMW) are made by "flying" a 2D outline against the "flow" of time as a third axis. At least the CMW is often made this way. You "view" by experiencing the things on the ring. The plane of the ring can "3D rotate." "Now" perturbations can be cyclically precessed or lagged very precisely by a few milliseconds to create both the sense of "flow" and by changing cyclic precession or lag phasically, you can draw 3D translucent skins. If a sound is axially offset from the ring, place it "artificially" a little too soon so as to get on a different ring, but at same phasic location, so as to "draw" the proper axial distance needed. In this way, you "barter with time," and use actual time distortions as a "wink wink" way of saying "imagine that there's a canvas flowing at 10 m/s and the phasic and cyclic distortions I use are painting the actual meaning of the sound, with the sound"!</p>

<p>I am awaiting permission to include this in a video or in my book, but the article on <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7553818/">Deep Posteromedial Cortical Rhythms in the Brain</a> is great, and I would recommend clicking to download supplemental videos 1 and 2. Also, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=7553818_nihms-1634078-f0012.jpg">this chart</a> within the site is amazing, showing how neural spike trains go from smooth to "cyclified" and "dissociated" after Ketamine.</p>

<h2>Perceptuo-Spatio-Genesis Theories to Address the Spatial Problem</h2>
<p>The second biggest problem I see regarding consciousness is how 3D spatial meaning can be created. I call this the "spatial problem." If you grant that the bank is how scenes in space are printed, then there is no spatial problem. But, the fact is, even this bank must come to have spatial meaning in the first place, so how does it get its space? There seems to be no "neurospatial" mechanism available in the brain to paint the things you see in daily life in an accurate 3D form. So it seems that some other method may be used by the brain for creating perceptual space, whether using amplitude or frequency modulation to somehow inflate 3D space, whether letting two patterns "piggyback" off each other, or whether pairing neural activity to actual movement in a meaningful way.</p>

<h2>Many Ideas Regarding the Mechanisms/Correlates Problems</h2>
<p>There is also the question of is the view of consciousness presented to a viewer for contemplation and action. Is this "viewer" the prefrontal cortex? Or the thalamus/basal ganglia? Is there an "awillic" version of consciousness generated by the retrosplenial cortex which requires no action but merely cinematic viewing of the story of self?</p>
<p>As you descend downward from "normal" consciousness further into these weeds, things split up more and more into little regions of the brain. Trying to understand which brain region does what, and what the specific mechanisms for "making consciousness" are gives rise to nearly endless theories, at least until one comes along that is satisfactory.</p>

<h2>What Is Sleep?</h2>
<p>When you fall asleep, GABA is released into the prefrontal cortex to inhibit it. As shown in <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0901435106">this study</a>, the back half of the brain, or the posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and angular gyri portion of the DMN (Default Mode Network), possibly the driver of the CMW imagination 10 Hz frames, lose their node in the medial frontal cortex during deep sleep. Could this front node be used to frequently get the CMW to model the SPW so as to tether you to the outside world? Then perhaps the CEN (Central Executive Network) mode might drive the 40-100 Hz frames of the SPW. After all, <a href="https://academy.o8t.com/brain-networks/central-executive-network#:~:text=Responsible%20for%20tasks%20and%20decision,other%20six%20main%20brain%20networks.">it is said to act as the "external mind."</a> The SN (Salience Network) could act as the toggling switch. Since DMN (CMW?) and CEN (SPW?) have varying levels of anti-correlation, at complete anti-correlation (one on means the other completely off), the brain would be showing one 1/40th second flick of CMW followed by one 1/40th second flick of SPW (has been experientially observed). When both are active, "you" could be paying some level of attention to both simultaneously, such as when CMW spatially overlaps SPW. Anyway, as you fall asleep, you lose the SPW, and the CMW conscribes the "where path" for use in making dreams (imagination) appear to be the only reality. So, falling asleep is essentially the mapping of all incoming stimuli to fit within what you're currently thinking about, rather than their actual source.</p>
