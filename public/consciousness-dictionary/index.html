                <h3>Qualia, Mainstream</h3>
                <p>The individual, subjective, and conscious experience of sensations. For example, the "redness" of the color red, the "painfulness" of pain, or the "sweetness" of sugar. Qualia are often considered the hardest problem of consciousness because their subjective nature makes them difficult to explain with objective, physical processes.</p>

            <div class="entry ring-bank">
                <h3>Qualia, Ring/Bank</h3>
                <p>The qualia stream is largely temporo-geometric. It is largely the same as the attention stream.</p>
                <p>Explicit qualia are the self-same as the mic voice event stream. Qualia have two components—tactile(somatic)(explicit) and paint(implicit). The intensity, timing, shape, location, and movement/acceleration/deceleration of the print of ringframes of consciousness is the explicit qualia stream. Red is not (or isn't necessarily) an explicit (texture) qualia in ring/bank understanding—it is an implicit (paint) qualia. Unexpected qualia additions from ring/bank thinking: acceleration qualia, selfness qualia, fear qualia, mood qualia, thought qualia, crunch of lettuce qualia. Qualia can be about reified objects outside the body (crisp crunch of lettuce) and be experienced outside of the body, as the entire worldsim is the creation of the brain.</p>

                <h3>Integrated Information Theory (IIT)</h3>
                <p>A theory of consciousness that posits consciousness is a physical property of matter that has the ability to cause-and-effect a large repertoire of states in an irreducible way. Consciousness is theorized to be related to the system's "phi" value, which is a measure of its integrated information.</p>

                <h3>Global Workspace Theory (GWT)</h3>
                <p>A theory that models consciousness as a "global broadcast" system in the brain. Unconscious processing modules compete for access to a central "global workspace," and whatever information wins access is broadcast to the entire system, making it conscious. The "winner-take-all" competition is often likened to a theatrical stage, where a limited number of actors are in the spotlight.</p>

                <h3>The Hard Problem</h3>
                <p>A term coined by philosopher David Chalmers to distinguish the question of subjective experience (why does it feel like anything to be us?) from the "easy problems," which are objective, functional questions about how the brain processes information and behavior. The Hard Problem asks how physical processes give rise to phenomenal consciousness.</p>

                <h3>Frame</h3>
                <p>An incomplete (2D) interpretation of a mic voice event, pre-meaning (incipient to full meaning attachment; i.e., prior to 'scratch-to-reveal' revelation of intended touched content).</p>
                <p>A low-dimensional (2D) reification (a concrete representation) of an event or stimulus as it is processed in the brain's time schema. These geometric representations are the fundamental building blocks of conscious experience.</p>
                <p>The keyframe at the beginning of a unit or chunk (or bin) of conscious reality, slightly analogous to a single frame in a film. In time schema, there is a series of distinct, low-frequency snapshots (amplitude crests of mic voice) that, once they unveil the content they are supposed to touch, the content is time-interpolable, and this content is what feels like smooth, flowing reality. The mic changes voices roughly 2-4 times a second, with each voice's speech (amplitude modulations) getting interpreted into its own short series of amplitude-varied ringframes (or full worldsim content).</p>

                <h3>Ring</h3>
                <p>An incomplete (0-1D) interpretation of a mic voice event, pre-meaning (incipient to full meaning attachment; i.e., prior to 'scratch-to-reveal' revelation of intended touched content).</p>
                <p>A low-dimensional (0-1D) reification (a concrete representation) of an event or stimulus as it is processed in the brain's time schema. These geometric representations are the fundamental building blocks of conscious experience. When the brain's buffer is not as exceeded, the mic voice events are interpreted more fully into 2D frames or even into the 3D volumetric worldsim content supposed to be touched by the ringframes.</p>

                <h3>Ringframe</h3>
                <p>A ring (0-1D) or frame (2D) incomplete interpretation of a mic voice event. See <em>Ring</em> or <em>Frame</em>.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="entry ring-bank">
                <h3>Mic (TDMA, IRQ)</h3>
                <p>The mic is an underappreciated concept in consciousness study, and it represents the conscious timestamping and most incipient conscious processing/awareness of any stimulus event. Stunningly, there is never any echo or phase-mismatch in perception for events. They seem to occur once, in perfect ordering and spacing. One can observe that further interpretation of these events has quite variable latency (5–500 ms), yet the varying interpretation lag never muddles the time record system of <em>Time Schema</em>. There is an ongoing tracking of a flowing window or buffer. The mic is critical to ring/bank theory.</p>
                <p>Attention rapidly (2-4 Hz) changes what it is listens to/hears/focuses on. The mic has a rapid gatekeeper or <em>Mic Bouncer</em>, rapidly switching who gets the mic. That is, there is a rapid (1–4 Hz) switch of its input source to a different part of the brain (or more broadly, rapidly changing the attended thing that gets to voice its amplitude modulations briefly). The brain takes turns listening to different sensory streams (visual, auditory, somatic, insular mood, etc.), giving each a brief moment of access to a central processing unit. This is an interrupt-style processing system akin to a computer's <strong>Interrupt Request (IRQ)</strong> or <strong>Time-Division Multiple Access (TDMA)</strong>, where different processes are handled in a rapid cycle.</p>
                <p>This mechanism allows differing modes or types of things to be the input to conscious attention and to reification to worldsim. An auditory voice (playing a song on car radio) leads to faint 3D mental imagery of the players or of the concepts discussed in the song. There is already decent evidence that this occurs in the Pulvinar of rats–that a series of neural bursts can magically change from being 'about' (and locking to timing of) air puffs to whiskers, to being 'about' (and locking to timing of) cyclic changes in visual field. </p>

            <div class="entry ring-bank">
                <h3>Mic Bouncer</h3>
                <p>Just as bars have bouncers determining who gets in, the conscious mic has a bouncer that rapidly (1–4 times per second) removes whoever (whatever mode or thing) is speaking and replaces them with another voice. For example, I may attend to the voice of typing on this Macbook keyboard. Then it begins raining or hailing, and that voice grabs the mic. Then I notice my leg bouncing. Then I notice my hunger. This is the rapid, real-time switching of voice. It is all-or-none. Certainly, the worldsim continues to float in most cases, but the mic of attended events seems to be monotoned, only capable of looking at one kind of ampitude modulation patterning at a time.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="entry ring-bank">
                <h3>Bank Schema</h3>
                <p>The printhead of consciousness.</p>
                <p>The play/record device of conscious geometry. By playing (printing) a shape, you also further record it onto the bank (greater rut or attraction for that shape).</p>
                <p>A 3D Etch-a-Sketch, but the tracer doesn't have to remain a 0D point—it can also utilize 1D rings or 2D frames. And, you don't print motion—you can only ever print static snapshots of or from the bank. Once printed, that-printed as a ringframe can be immediately flowing and fading in time schema, but the print itself was static.</p>
                <p>The lifetime agglomeration of all <em>Ringframe</em> manifolds. It is the repository of the shape of all past perceptual experiences (and more so of the shape of condensed attention [ringframes]), similar to a mental library or database. The brain pulls from this bank to interpret new incoming signals, effectively giving meaning and context to each new frame of reality.</p>

            <div class="entry ring-bank">
                <h3>Schema</h3>
                <p>1. A useful grouping of information; e.g., all information pertaining to your car is a your-car-schema.</p>
                <p>2. A (3D) volume of congruent worldsim; e.g., real schema fits in a single 3D volume. A single spin-up of imaginal schema also fits into a single 3D volume, but as it is non-veridical to real schema, it must overlay that volume in a fairly happenstantial and possibly heteroscaled manner.</p>
                <p>There are four typical schemas in ring/bank theory: <em>Real Schema</em>, <em>Imaginal Schema</em>, <em>Time Schema</em>, and <em>Shape Schema</em> (the last is also called <em>Bank Schema</em>). The first two schemas (real and imaginal) are sometimes also referred to as <em>Paint</em>.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="entry ring-bank">
                <h3>Paint</h3>
                <p>The meaningful content that floats or remains utilizable and perceptually visible as long as there is an ongoing complete (successful), low-latency interpretation of the mic voice events (and possibly also subconscious information) into reified posterior (experience). Paint 'floats' when the brain is operating optimally. In sedation, sleep deprivation, and traumatic events, a heightened burst mode may be entered globally by the cortex, which seems to result in an inability to fully inflate or interpret <em>Inputs</em> to <em>Posteriors</em>, using <em>Priors</em>. In this mode where the buffer is exceeded, or latency of interpretation is too great, the paint can 'cease to float,' whereby one gets <em>Paint Anesthesia</em>—the loss of the 3D volume of experience.</p>
                <p>As paint requires a view and a viewer, a simple rough understanding of paint is that it is <em>Perspective</em>, as opposed to mere <em>Physics</em>-modeling (In Blender animations, one must first set up the physics of the scene and any keyframed movements of the objects; then, one must also set a camera and any camera movement keyframes for shooting the perspective impingment of that 4D (3D+Time) physics playout upon a camera). However, paint is both the physics-playout <strong>and</strong> the perspective impingment onto the avatar's/mind's eye's visual field; it also includes the complex meanings of auditory, somatic, and conceptual contributions as well. So, paint is omnimodal. Ringframes are a physics-playout model, and they have to 'scratch-to-reveal' the paint: the physics-playout model of content and of the avatar's perspective viewing it.</p>
                <p>When paint floats, an <em>Avatar</em> or <em>Mind's Eye</em> must also float or be rendered.</p>

                <h3>CMW—Cartoon Motor World</h3>
                <p>A first term coined to describe a volume of non-veridical or imaginal worldsim. See also <em>Imaginal Schema</em>.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>SPW—Sensory Physical World</h3>
                <p>A first term coined to describe the volume of veridical or real worldsim. See also <em>Real Schema</em>.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>Paint Anesthesia</h3>
                <p>Full anesthesia results in the loss of conscious experience of time, or of events, or of the sense of self. Paint anesthesia is the partial loss of one component of consciousness—the full 3D volumetric experience. In paint anesthesia, time, events (with amplitude), and possibly ringframes are still experienced, and the volumetric worldsim paint can often be deduced from the limited touchpoints, but is not explicitly rendered (is not perceptually visible). Paint anesthesia shows up occasionally in sedation and in heavy sedation.</p>

            <div class="entry ring-bank">
                <h3>Throw</h3>
                <p>Acceleration/deceleration qualia.</p>
                <p>The unexpected movement of the bank printhead of consciousness (relative to the last printed frame), as caused by (or subconsciously rendered as) unexpected external force.</p>
                <p>The unexpected movement of attention to render that an external force has occurred. If you are riding in a car and it turns sharply left, your attention (the bank printhead) will be thrown rightward to render the force of the turn.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="entry ring-bank">
                <h3>Vibes</h3>
                <p>Scaler/positional change qualia.</p>
                <p>Changes in amplitude of the mic voice in real time, to encode salient keyframes of peaks/troughs of the amplitude envelope of that voice.</p>
                <p>When listening to music, the peaks in intensity sometimes result in ringframes with peaked radial scale. There are many other ways besides radial scale that amplitude envelope peaks gain fitting geometric representation prior to full 3D schema interpretation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="entry ring-bank">
                <h3>Flow</h3>
                <p>The linear or logarithmic continual movement of timestamped ringframes in time schema along the time axis over time. The ringframe is already moving at flow velocity as soon as it is printed (no acceleration needed). The ringframe fades in opacity over roughly 0.1–5 seconds, though it may leave a utilistic impression (memory) for an entire lifetime. Utility (memory) is a lower opacity that falls below perceptual visibility noise gate.</p>
                <p>When listening to music, a note ringframe flows quickly (roughly 0.3 m/s) as it fades into past. When walking, earth schema (a part of real schema) may flow backwards relative to body schema at roughly 0.1 m/s. Other qualia may sometimes invoke faster, 1–2 m/s, flow rates. The voxels of a worldsim may be revolvingly refreshed (like a sweeping radar plane forming a donut) at 10+ times a second, resulting in 3–12 m/s movement of the bank printhead.</p>

            <div class="entry ring-bank">
                <h3>2D/1D Manifolds</h3>
                <p>Many think of 2D objects or manifolds as planar. I think of a 2D manifold/object as a surface that appears flat locally. I would consider the skin surface over your entire body to be a 2D manifold for this reason. Yes, it requires a 3D embedding space. Yes, it takes up 3D volume in a sense. But if the manifold itself is 2D or flat-like locally, I consider the entire manifold to be 2D. Thus, frames of consciousness are defined as 2D manifolds in this way, requiring and sometimes taking up a 3D volume to exist. Frames can also be literal 2D planar manifolds though, at times, as well.</p>
                <p>This entire principle also applies to 1D manifolds, which I would consider to be a line manifold in a 1D embedding space, or a line or curve manifold in a 2D or 3D embedding space. If the surface is 1D-like at the tiny, local scale, I consider the whole thing 1D. Rings are 1D manifolds in this way, though it is possible for them to require anything from a 1D to a 2D to a 3D embedding space (a ring can be a straight line in very rare cases).</p>
