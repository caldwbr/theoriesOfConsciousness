                <p>The brain's dual-temporal processing where ringframes have varying postdiction latencies fitting into the ongoing worldsim, while the worldsim itself uses varying prediction anti-latencies to anticipate its own 3D state.</p>

                <p><strong>Temporal Architecture:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Filtered Mic Line (30 ms latency):</strong> The signal, perhaps decided by thalamus, upon which consciousness is booted and corrected/guided.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Boot (500-2000 ms):</strong> Worldsim startup requires substantial postdictive processing to establish baseline</li>
                    <li><strong>Postdictive Lag (5-500 ms):</strong> Ongoing ringframes take variable time to be interpreted and fit into worldsim</li>
                    <li><strong>Predictive Interpolation:</strong> Once running, worldsim uses prediction to float close to present, compensating for lag</li>
                    <li><strong>Unexpected Events:</strong> Mic line surprises disrupt the predictive float, requiring fresh postdictive processing</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>The Profound Insight:</strong></p>
                <p>Consciousness boots up slowly (500-1000 ms) through pure postdiction, then runs on dual-temporal processing: postdiction fitting ringframes into worldsim while prediction interpolates the worldsim forward. The predictive float keeps you near real-time, except when unexpected mic events force a postdictive recalibration.</p>

                <p><strong>Relationship to Agency:</strong></p>
                <p>This architecture enables sophisticated action—we act based on a worldsim that's mostly predictive (keeping us current) but grounded in postdictive reality checks. The initial boot time explains why waking up or shifting attention feels gradual.</p>

                <p>The system maintains temporal coherence: prediction gives us the "now" feeling, postdiction ensures it matches reality, and the occasional mic surprise keeps everything honest.</p>

                    <h3 class="entry-title">Noise Gate</h3>
                    <span class="category-tag category-tag-signals">Signals</span>
                </div>
                <p>The brain's dynamic amplitude threshold that controls which sensory signals reach conscious awareness, varying dramatically between normal and sedated states.</p>
                <p>In a guitar pedal, a noise gate reduces low-volume input to zero, only allowing intentional strums of the guitar to come through. This is a choppy on/off type filter applied to the signal path.</p>
                <p><strong>State-Dependent Operation:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Normal State:</strong> Minimal noise gating—rich gamma activity flows freely, allowing detailed conscious processing</li>
                    <li><strong>Sedated State:</strong> High noise gate threshold—only the strongest signals pass through, but when they do, they broadcast fully to capture "whole brain" attention</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Sedation Mechanism:</strong></p>
                <p>Under hyperpolarization, the noise gate operates in a burst-refractory cycle: strong signal rises above threshold → widespread neural burst → long refractory period with high gating → wait → next strong signal triggers burst (~2Hz in heavy sedation).</p>

                <p><strong>World Simulation Maintenance:</strong></p>
                <p>These sparse bursts aren't isolated conscious moments—they're touchpoints that scratch to reveal content and attempt to float a worldsim. Consciousness can still interpolate the world simulation between 2-4Hz frames, though it becomes progressively harder as frame rate drops.</p>

                <p><strong>Frequency Consequences:</strong></p>
                <p>This explains the shift from gamma-dominated normal consciousness to low-frequency swamp during sedation. The high noise gate filters out high-frequency detail while permitting only occasional, powerful low-frequency events to serve as anchors for world simulation.</p>

                <p>The noise gate thus acts as consciousness's volume knob—wide open during alert states for rich experience, nearly closed during sedation where only the loudest signals create sparse touchpoints for world simulation.</p>

                <p>The qualia stream is largely temporo-geometric. It is largely the same as the attention stream.</p>
                <p>Explicit qualia are the self-same as the mic voice event stream. Qualia have two components—tactile(somatic)(explicit) and paint(implicit). The intensity, timing, shape, location, and movement/acceleration/deceleration of the print of ringframes of consciousness is the explicit qualia stream. Red is not (or isn't necessarily) an explicit (texture) qualia in ring/bank understanding—it is an implicit (paint) qualia. Unexpected qualia additions from ring/bank thinking: acceleration qualia, selfness qualia, fear qualia, mood qualia, thought qualia, crunch of lettuce qualia. Qualia can be about reified objects outside the body (crisp crunch of lettuce) and be experienced outside of the body, as the entire worldsim is the creation of the brain.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Ringframes that print with an attached <em>mic event</em>—a transient heartbeat, noise, note of music, change in direction of limb, etc. These are the frames where something actually “voices” into the worldsim, whether it is a sound, a syllable, a flash of movement, or an explicit thought-stroke.</p>
                <p>They are the tracer strokes meaningfully locked to transients: the heartbeat pulse, the word onset, the drum hit, the geometric edge, the change in direction of a body limb, etc.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Ringframes that occur at their natural cadence without carrying any mic event or useful timing. It is akin to a video needing 24 frames per second. The timing of the frames doesn't matter when voiceless, only that they occur frequently enough to make it seem like continuous video. This is in contrast to the majority duty-mode of consciousness, which is voiced, where frames align to salient events.</p>
                <p>Example: in a hypnagogic state, lying in silence, no inner dialogue, no sounds—just 3D imagery of ongoing thought—which you realize is getting printed or 'scratched-to-reveal' by ringframes whose timing may be about 10 Hz but not locked to anything in particular.</p>

                <p>Ringframes that are tied to an expected stream of content (heartbeat, syllable, perceptual event) but which arrive when there is no actual event to bind. They still print, but print nothing meaningful, serving as placeholders.</p>
                <p>Example: while tracking heartbeat, one ringframe prints the first thump, the next fires in the gap and maps to nothing, and the following one prints the next thump. The empty middle frame is a filler ringframe: structurally present, but meaningless.</p>

                <p>A phasic mode of ring operation where the completion of one ring's cycle (at phase 2π) coincides precisely with the initiation of the next ring's cycle (at phase 0). This creates seamless, uninterrupted cycling with no inter-cycle interval, making the 0-to-0 interval equal to the 0-to-2π interval.</p>

                <p>A dynamic pattern where the active phase duration (0-to-2π interval) progressively shortens over successive cycles while the cycle period (0-to-0 interval) remains constant. This results in a decreasing duty cycle and increasing inter-cycle intervals without changing the fundamental cycling frequency.</p>

                <p>The fundamental ethical principle that guides all moral action: "Do no harm to any sentient being, except in genuine self-defense." This universal maxim transcends political and religious boundaries, serving as the bedrock of compassionate coexistence.</p>

                <p>Natural law emerges from the deep well of empathy—the capacity to feel with others and recognize their inherent worth. It harmonizes with the protection of innocent life, ethical treatment of animals, and the defense of human dignity across all cultures and circumstances.</p>

                <p>This principle stands against cruelty in all its forms: from the quiet violence of economic oppression to the overt brutality of armed conflict. It calls us to see every person as worthy of protection, every life as sacred, and every act of harm as a violation of our shared humanity.</p>

                <p>Natural law invites us into a more courageous way of being—one where we extend our circle of concern beyond tribe and nation to embrace all who share the capacity to suffer and dream. It represents our highest potential: to build a world where safety and dignity are not privileges, but birthrights.</p>

The “winner-take-all” competition is often likened to a theatrical stage, where a limited number of actors are in the spotlight.</p>

                <p>A brilliant video by Art of the Problem that traces the conceptual lineage of modern AI from recurrent neural networks through dynamical systems and attractor networks. The video beautifully illustrates how concepts from physics and dynamical systems theory provide the mathematical foundation for understanding how neural networks process information and exhibit emergent intelligent behavior.</p>

                <p>Experimental evidence showing 5.15 Hz amplitude modulation PCA rings in the gamma band (50-60Hz) of EEG during music listening. This demonstrates the core Ring/Bank Theory prediction that conscious processing organizes into rotating wave patterns of amplitude modulation propagating across cortex. The 5.15 Hz ring frequency suggests a fundamental temporal architecture for conscious auditory experience.</p>

                <p>The keyframe at the beginning of a unit or chunk (or bin) of conscious reality, slightly analogous to a single frame in a film. In time schema, there is a series of distinct, low-frequency snapshots (amplitude crests of mic voice) that, once they unveil the content they are supposed to touch, the content is time-interpolable, and this content is what feels like smooth, flowing reality.

                <p>Below, the grey is the deduced content (your body). It is deduced from the neural activity, which begins at red dot and progresses along yellow ring trajectory through orange, green, and blue dots over about 500 ms in this case. The raw neural activity is mapped to the ring more incipiently than it 'scratches-to-reveal' the location and presence of your body. In actuality, it is the changing <em>Content</em> that 'moves' the neural activity around the ring trajectory. The neural activity doesn't literally move. In this way, geometric understanding can be gained by the structured or orchestrated changing of what neural activity is 'about.' Matching the change in 'about' with the change in time and an assumed shape trajectory binds the conscious brain together.</p>
                <p>This is a depiction of the first ring experienced. It was <em>Phasic Mode</em>, meaning the ring did not print all at once, but rather began at the location denoted by the red dot and moved around to orange, etc. The encoding at the red dot was 'left elbow will open,' then at the orange dot was my mood/outlook, then at the green dot encoded what noise I would hear the furnace make, then I'm not sure what the blue dot was, perhaps visual field information if I wanted to focus in enough. After the ring was laid down by the tracer over roughly 500 ms, there was a gap where worldsim churned through experiencing the 3D video of that infomation, followed by another ring. The ring, as a keyframe header of sorts to the chunk of experience, seemed to lay down flat informational encoding. The gear turn between rings seems to be the living out of that info.</p>

In the demonstration below, only the inner cylinder is shown, as part of the <em>Bank Schema</em>. The zigzags (<em>Chevrons</em>) are sometimes laid down during strobed states (such as when wearing Kasina strobe glasses, flashing at 10 Hz). The frequency of Kasina glasses (/neural oscillations in V1) is sometimes exactly the rate of the bank revolution, tying the rate of rhythmic stimulus and brain oscillation directly to the rate of geometric behavior in perception. For example, Kasina strobe glasses set at 13 Hz, each flash may appear as the bank getting back from a revolution and impacting to create the perceptual flash. Rhythmic timing often equals revolution timing.</p>

Allowing history impingement <em>Flow</em> into <em>Time Schema</em> forms a sort of fading square helix.

                </div>
                <p><strong>Phase Saccades</strong> are deliberate, effortful jumps of attention that propel consciousness against the natural gradient of <strong>Phase Flow</strong>. While Phase Flow represents the spontaneous, relaxation-driven drift between perceptual states (whether far→near, bottom→top, or any phenomenological axis), Phase Saccades require cognitive energy to transition against the prevailing direction—whether moving to distant regions or reversing course by any amount.</p>
                <p>This dynamic creates a navigation system where attention moves between quantized perceptual states called <strong>ringframes</strong>: flowing effortlessly along natural gradients or making intentional leaps against them.</p>
                <p>Consider the 2D image below, left. It is bistable, as it could be interpreted to a far or near pop-out to 3D. In such a case, the brain may instantiate a flow from far (high potential) to near (low potential) state. Refreshing to a higher level requires an effortful saccadic jump. By saccade is not meant anything with the eyes, but rather with the location of attention. In ring/bank theory, you (phenomenal) don't have eyes and you aren't a body (unless attention goes there) (in physical world, you have a body and eyes, they are not directly observable), at least you are more directly a series of ringframes, and even more directly you are the physical neural activity encoding those ringframes. So, the phase-saccades are as embodied as regular saccades. Relaxation carries you from the far to the near in quantized steps (~100 ms each <em>Ringframe</em>), effortful phase-saccades are required to jump back further or all the way to the origin farthest ringframe.</p>
                <p>Phase saccades tend to occur in <em>Interrupt Mode</em> rather than <em>Phasic Mode</em>, which might be confusing. We are talking about two different kinds of phase.</p>

                <p>A system that divides worldsim volume via discrete <em>Ringframes</em> at specific, linearly-sequential phase-locations (often spaced 100–200 ms apart in a 1–2 second cycle, but variable). Like the video's vertical circles lighting up sequentially along a body, bright frames give each spatial location its moment of attention, while dark frames (not shown here, could be above or below the body) create the return path—forming a toroidal cycle that repeats continuously.</p>

                <p>The division of 1-2 second chunks into these phase-keyframes ensures different schema regions take turns: not every location accesses attention simultaneously. Same concept as TDMA, but for competing spaces rather than conceptual voices.</p>

                <p>In Kant's philosophy, the noumenal realm is the world of “things-in-themselves,” existing independently of our perception. It is a reality that is unknowable and inaccessible to human reason and sensory experience. While we cannot have direct knowledge of the noumenal, Kant argued that it must exist as the source of our phenomenal experience. Ring/bank thinking fully embraces this distinction, calling the noumenal realm the actual physical universe, which is not directly observable.</p>

                <p>An American neuroscientist from MIT who is a leading voice in the study of brain waves. While many in the field have traditionally viewed brain waves as a mere byproduct of neural activity—like the exhaust from an engine—Miller has argued that they are, in fact, the brain’s <strong>fundamental language of communication</strong>. His research demonstrates how different frequency bands (such as gamma, beta, and alpha waves) work together to control cognitive functions like attention and working memory. According to his theory, gamma waves package information while slower beta waves provide a top-down signal, acting as a “director” to gate and prioritize information. His work suggests that a true understanding of cognition requires a deeper appreciation for how these rhythmic oscillations may orchestrate cognition.</p>

According to Orch-OR, consciousness results from “orchestrated” quantum collapses within these structures, making it a phenomenon that is both non-computational and fundamentally linked to the physical laws of the universe. He is also a prominent figure in the field for his role in organizing and hosting the <strong>Science of Consciousness conferences</strong>, which have become a major international forum for discussing the nature of conscious experience.</p>

This cyclopean eye results into a doubled environment schema, with a range of crossed and uncrossed disparities from foveal gaze voxel going closer and farther from focal plane, respectively. It also fuses the left eye gaze vector and right eye gaze vector into a single cyclopean gaze vector.

                <p>Radial memory structures in bank space where multiple instances of the same content type stack along the time dimension, with current instances at the outermost radius and historical instances progressing inward toward the origin. The bank's apparent 3D organization masks higher-dimensional sorting where content types cluster along additional axes.</p>
                <p>Example: The "dad opening kitchen door" skewer contains every instance of that specific event, stacked radially with recent occurrences at large radius and childhood memories near the center. When this pattern activates, you see the entire historical stack simultaneously—the current door opening printed against the backdrop of thousands of previous openings.</p>
                <p>The letter 'b' skewer works similarly: all 'b's ever written organize radially, with your current 'b' following the pre-carved geometric pathway through this stack. The fact you only access 'b' content when writing 'b' suggests additional sorting dimensions—like content type or semantic category—that function as automatic routing keys.</p>
                <p>For "dad gum it," the skewer contains every utterance across your lifetime, each instance storing not just the phonemes but the emotional context, vocal inflection, and situational framing. Current usage rides this pre-carved emotional pathway—the printing follows the existing rut rather than computing the phrase anew, which explains why certain expressions carry accumulated emotional weight.</p>
                <p>Skewers represent cached computation pathways: frequently used patterns get physically encoded as preferred trajectories, making recurrent operations efficient but constraining variation. The radial time-stacking allows momentary overview of a concept's entire evolutionary history when the ring prints near that coordinate in bank space.</p>

                <p>The quantized advance of the union set (current ringframe) across a discrete landscape of possible locations and shapes in worldsim space. When the system remains relaxed, the union set will click forward to the next available spatial slot—each with defined dimensional properties.</p>
                <p>Example: You might see ten identical chunks arranged from right to left, each measuring 1" thick × 4' tall × 4' deep, spaced 6" apart. The union set assumes these exact dimensions and advances in discrete steps from the rightmost slot toward the leftmost slot. Each position is visibly predetermined—like giant piano keys in space—where conscious attention will land if you remain passive.</p>
                <p>Phase flow operates in interrupt mode, advancing the union set's spatial configuration in quantum jumps rather than continuous motion. The available target positions are constrained and discrete—you're clicking between predefined spatial waypoints, each with fixed dimensional properties that the union set must adopt.</p>
                <p>To move backward or skip positions requires a phase saccade against the natural gradient. The progression can follow two patterns: either it jumps instantly (via a large <em>Phase Saccade</em>) from the final position back to the first (like a video loop), or it rotates behind (or above/below) and eventually comes back to the right side, taking a repeatable torus or giant ring path.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The printing of <em>Rings</em> in <em>Time Schema</em> can be periodic or aperiodic, depending somewhat on the stimulus.</p>
                <p>When periodic, the frequency can be dynamic (changing), as below. As a further distinction, the printing of rings need not always be rhythmic–rings often print to salient events such as notes in music or random noises, which may be aperiodic. In general, the print of a ring tends to create a bit of a refractory period just after it. Quiet and high frequency stimuli (such as music and scent) can overcome this refractory period since the initial ring print does not use as much reservoir.</p>

If you imagine bending your toe, you may get mental imagery, where the toe is 1' as it overlays real schema. We know a toe in reality is about 1". In this example, the scale of imaginal:real is 1 cubic foot = 1 cubic inch. In those cases where two schemas are equal scale, they are homoscalar. Where they are different volumetric scales, they are heteroscaler.</p>

                    <span class="category-tag category-tag-ring-bank">Ring/Bank</span>
                </div>
                <p>The mic is an underappreciated concept in consciousness study, and it represents the conscious timestamping and most incipient conscious processing/awareness of any stimulus event. Stunningly, there is never any echo or phase-mismatch in perception for events. They seem to occur once, in perfect ordering and spacing. One can observe that further interpretation of these events has quite variable latency (5–500 ms), yet the varying interpretation lag never muddles the time record system of <em>Time Schema</em>. There is an ongoing tracking of a flowing window or buffer. The mic is critical to ring/bank theory.</p>
                <p>Attention rapidly (2-4 Hz) changes what it is listens to/hears/focuses on. The mic has a rapid gatekeeper or <em>Mic Bouncer</em>, rapidly switching who gets the mic. That is, there is a rapid (1–4 Hz) switch of its input source to a different part of the brain (or more broadly, rapidly changing the attended thing that gets to voice its amplitude modulations briefly). The brain takes turns listening to different sensory streams (visual, auditory, somatic, insular mood, etc.), giving each a brief moment of access to a central processing unit. This is an interrupt-style processing system akin to a computer's <strong>Interrupt Request (IRQ)</strong> or <strong>Time-Division Multiple Access (TDMA)</strong>, where different processes are handled in a rapid cycle.</p>
                <p>This mechanism allows differing modes or types of things to be the input to conscious attention and to reification to worldsim. An auditory voice (playing a song on car radio) leads to faint 3D mental imagery of the players or of the concepts discussed in the song. There is already decent evidence that this occurs in the Pulvinar of rats–that a series of neural bursts can magically change from being 'about' (and locking to timing of) air puffs to whiskers, to being 'about' (and locking to timing of) cyclic changes in visual field. </p>

                <p>Just as bars have bouncers determining who gets in, the conscious mic has a bouncer that rapidly (1–4 times per second) removes whoever (whatever mode or thing) is speaking and replaces them with another voice. For example, I may attend to the voice of typing on this Macbook keyboard. Then it begins raining or hailing, and that voice grabs the mic. Then I notice my leg bouncing. Then I notice my hunger. This is the rapid, real-time switching of voice. It is all-or-none. Certainly, the worldsim continues to float in most cases, but the mic of attended events seems to be monotoned, only capable of looking at one kind of amplitude modulation patterning at a time.</p>

                </div>

                <p>The print and record head of consciousness—both generating spatial experience and storing the geometric patterns that shape attention.</p>
                <p><strong>Stroboscopic Operation:</strong></p>
                <p>The Bank Schema constantly transforms beneath awareness, only visible during "strobe" photographs (loud, bursty mic events during sedation) that capture its current state—position, orientation, scale, and geometric configuration.</p>

                <p>Each strobe-printed ringframe (which can include a faint print of much of the bank) persists 500-1000ms while fading, creating overlapping windows that reveal the Bank's motion between illuminations.</p>
                <p><strong>Core Mechanism:</strong></p>
                <p>Operates as consciousness's 3D Etch-a-Sketch, printing static geometric snapshots (ringframes) that can immediately flow in Time Schema. The tracer can be 0D (point), 1D (ring), or 2D (frame), but motion is never printed—only static instantiations from the Bank's shape library.</p>
                <p>The bank can be in front of you, it can be inside you (e.g., if your attention is on your lung), it can lock to your head, it can lock to your hand during tool use, etc.</p>
                <p><strong>Print/Record Function:</strong></p>
                <p>Each printed shape simultaneously records itself deeper into the Bank, creating self-reinforcing attention patterns. This dual-action mechanism means consciousness literally writes its own geometric habits through the act of attention.</p>

                <p><strong>Geometric Foundation:</strong></p>
                <p>The Bank is organized around a sphere centroid that serves as the universal scaling reference. All shapes scale relative to this point while maintaining their individual positions:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Primary Structures:</strong> Concentric sphere and cube shells form the Bank's backbone</li>
                    <li><strong>Strong Spin-Lock:</strong> Broken drinking glass (right-offset, 15° clockwise tilt, break forward)</li>
                    <li><strong>Secondary Anchors:</strong> Pyramid hat (atop cubes) and slanted leg (below) provide additional orientation cues</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Spin-Lock Necessity:</strong></p>
                <p>Without asymmetric anchors, symmetric shapes would create perceptual ambiguity: spheres allow infinite rotations, cubes allow six. The broken glass enforces singular orientation, making coherent spatial framing possible.</p>

                <p><strong>Possible Mechanism for Bank Revelation:</strong></p>
                <p>During hyperpolarized states (sedation), sparse coding in retrosplenial cortex layer 5 may fail. Burst firing could recruit excessive ensembles, causing each ringframe to print both its primary content AND the entire 3D Bank structure. This might create extended periods where consciousness witnesses its own geometric foundation—the sphere and cube shells prominently visible, all scaling relative to the sphere centroid.</p>

                <p><strong>Beyond Geometry:</strong></p>
                <p>While the Bank handles spatial representation, consciousness includes non-geometric elements like emotions—which function as abstract behavioral filters in concept space rather than geometric forms.</p>

                <p><strong>Q&amp;A:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>How does the Bank represent complex real-world shapes?</strong></p>
                <p>It doesn't replicate visual detail. The Bank prints the <em>attended shape union set</em>—the geometric interface between schemas. When attending to fine details, the Bank typically uses radial scaling (see <em>Skewers</em>) rather than high-resolution replication.</p>

                <p>Ultimately, the Bank Schema reveals the geometric aspect of consciousness—a print/record system where attention both generates and is shaped by spatial patterns.</p>

                <p>1. A useful grouping of information; e.g., all information pertaining to your car is a your-car-schema.</p>
                <p>2. A (3D) volume of congruent worldsim; e.g., real schema fits in a single 3D volume. A single spin-up of imaginal schema also fits into a single 3D volume, but as it is non-veridical to real schema, it must overlay that volume in a fairly happenstantial and possibly heteroscaled manner.</p>
                <p>There are four typical schemas in ring/bank theory: <em>Real Schema</em>, <em>Imaginal Schema</em>, <em>Time Schema</em>, and <em>Shape Schema</em> (the last is also called <em>Bank Schema</em>). The first two schemas (real and imaginal) are sometimes also referred to as <em>Paint</em>.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The meaningful content that floats or remains utilizable and perceptually visible as long as there is an ongoing complete (successful), low-latency interpretation of the mic voice events (and possibly also subconscious information) into reified posterior (experience). Paint 'floats' when the brain is operating optimally. In sedation, sleep deprivation, and traumatic events, a heightened burst mode may be entered globally by the cortex, which seems to result in an inability to fully inflate or interpret <em>Inputs</em> to <em>Posteriors</em>, using <em>Priors</em>. In this mode where the buffer is exceeded, or latency of interpretation is too great, the paint can 'cease to float,' whereby one gets <em>Paint Anesthesia</em>—the loss of the 3D volume of experience.</p>
                <p>As paint requires a view and a viewer, a simple rough understanding of paint is that it is <em>Perspective</em>, as opposed to mere <em>Physics</em>-modeling (In Blender animations, one must first set up the physics of the scene and any keyframed movements of the objects; then, one must also set a camera and any camera movement keyframes for shooting the perspective impingment of that 4D (3D+Time) physics playout upon a camera). However, paint is both the physics-playout <strong>and</strong> the perspective impingment onto the avatar's/mind's eye's visual field; it also includes the complex meanings of auditory, somatic, and conceptual contributions as well. So, paint is omnimodal. Ringframes are a physics-playout model, and they have to 'scratch-to-reveal' the paint: the physics-playout model of content and of the avatar's perspective viewing it.</p>
                <p>When paint floats, an <em>Avatar</em> or <em>Mind's Eye</em> must also float or be rendered.</p>

                </div>

                <p>The Union Set is a 0-2D manifold that serves as the current cross-schema registration interface between four independent 3D coordinate systems (real, imaginal, time, and shape schemas).</p>
                <p>Mechanically: It functions as attention's dynamic binding mechanism that establishes momentary isometry between schemas by forcing alignment of their local coordinate frames around the attended object or region.</p>
                <p>Operationally: When attention selects a target, the Union Set computes and maintains a temporary rigid transformation matrix that maps all four schema coordinate systems to a common reference frame centered on the attended element.</p>
                <p>Dynamically: As attention moves or the attended object transforms, the Union Set updates this transformation matrix in real-time, causing counter-rotations and translations of entire schema volumes relative to each other to preserve the current binding.</p>
                <p>Historically: Previous Union Sets decompose into separate memory traces along geodesic paths determined by the accumulated transformation differentials between successive attention frames.</p>
                <p>In the head-turn example: The Union Set establishes head-centered coordinates at t=0. During imagined rotation, it computes the minimal counter-rotation of the imaginal schema needed to maintain head-alignment, generating the observed leftward displacement of the previous frame's imaginal component as a direct consequence of this transformation calculus.</p>
                <p>Below, the four main schemas (real, imaginal, shape, time) are depicted alongside their present moment union set (1D ring manifold in this case, depicted in blue here).</p>

              </div>
              <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A single, out-of-band <em>preempt</em> frame that injects a tagged payload (memory cue, scene shard, action thought) and then <em>immediately returns</em> scheduling to the prior stream (typically Real). The SIF itself does not pin or hold selection beyond that one frame.</p>
              <p><strong>Mechanism:</strong> A high-salience tag stack (emotion/novelty/self) wins one frame of priority, prints its payload, and drops. Foreground selection resumes as before; meanwhile a metacognitive loop begins to reverberate on the injected content (see <em>Tag Echo</em>).</p>
              <p><strong>Phenomenology:</strong> A crisp “snap-in” moment (smell/name/flash) followed by immediate return to the scene, while the mind keeps <em>thinking about</em> the injected thing in the background.</p>
              <p><strong>Example:</strong> Driving and smelling cedar → one frame slams in a childhood porch. Vision immediately returns to the road, but you find yourself mulling that porch for the next minute.</p>

              <p><strong>Definition:</strong> An interleaved selection regime where a 0D tracer advances along one geometric path while alternating schema instantiations (e.g., Real then Imaginal, voxel by voxel). The experience can fuse into one stream when paint bandwidth is high and handoff latency is low; under load it reveals itself as a braid (micro-flicker/tearing).</p>
              <p><strong>Notes:</strong> Phase Weave stability depends on (i) stroke budget (S), (ii) paint bandwidth (Bₚ), (iii) union half-life (τᵤ), and (iv) schema handoff latency (Lₕ). Failures produce plaid/checkerboard qualia, pop-in events when debt settles, and trailing counter-movement when union fades unevenly.</p>
              <p><strong>Example:</strong> Alternating heartbeat palpation with a vivid moving mental image on a 1:1 cadence; at moderate rates the two fuse, at higher rates the weave becomes visible.</p>

                <p>Full anesthesia results in the loss of conscious experience of time, or of events, or of the sense of self. Paint anesthesia is the partial loss of one component of consciousness—the full 3D volumetric experience. In paint anesthesia, time, events (with amplitude), and possibly ringframes are still experienced, and the volumetric worldsim paint can often be deduced from the limited touchpoints, but is not explicitly rendered (is not perceptually visible). Paint anesthesia shows up occasionally in sedation and in heavy sedation.</p>

    </div>
    
    <p>The continuous deformation and restoration of the Bank Schema's (and the Union Set's) coordinate alignment with the Real Schema during acceleration profiles, where the displacement and return dynamics precisely mirror the force application curve.</p>
    
    <p>Mechanically: The Bank Schema doesn't simply jump to an offset position and snap back. It undergoes smooth deformation—the coordinate transformation between Bank and Real schemas follows the exact acceleration profile, including the jerk (derivative of acceleration) that determines how smoothly or abruptly forces are applied.</p>
    
    <p>In the car turn example: As the steering wheel turns left, the Bank Schema's rightward displacement follows the steering input's smoothness. A gentle turn produces gradual coordinate deformation; a jerky turn creates abrupt transformation changes. The return to equilibrium similarly mirrors the steering wheel's return dynamics—the Bank Schema "unwinds" along the same temporal profile as the force removal.</p>
    
    <p>This reveals that the brain implements a full dynamic system: The coordinate transformation between Bank and Real schemas behaves like a damped spring system where the displacement follows the force input profile in real-time, including higher-order derivatives like jerk.</p>
    
    <p>The qualia of throw therefore contains rich temporal information: You don't just feel "pushed right"—you feel the smoothness of the push, the sustained pressure, and the character of the return. This temporal resolution suggests the brain is implementing something akin to a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller for coordinate alignment during acceleration.</p>
    
    <p>This dynamic matching explains why different driving styles feel qualitatively different: A race car's abrupt turns create sharp, high-jerk throw sensations, while a luxury car's smooth turns produce gradual, low-jerk displacements. The Bank Schema isn't just tracking force magnitude—it's tracking the entire force application profile.</p>
    
    <p>The computational implication: The brain maintains a real-time dynamic model of the coordinate transformation between Bank and Real schemas that includes velocity and acceleration terms, not just positional offsets.</p>

The ringframe fades in opacity over roughly 0.1–5 seconds, though it may leave a utilistic impression (memory) for an entire lifetime. Utility (memory) is a lower opacity that falls below perceptual visibility noise gate.</p>
                <p>When listening to music, a note ringframe flows quickly (roughly 0.3 m/s) as it fades into past. When walking, earth schema (a part of real schema) may flow backwards relative to body schema at roughly 0.1 m/s. Other qualia may sometimes invoke faster, 1–2 m/s, flow rates. The voxels of a worldsim may be revolvingly refreshed (like a sweeping radar plane forming a donut) at 10+ times a second, resulting in 3–12 m/s movement of the bank printhead.</p>

                <p>Many think of 2D objects or manifolds as planar. I think of a 2D manifold/object as a surface that appears flat locally. I would consider the skin surface over your entire body to be a 2D manifold for this reason. Yes, it requires a 3D embedding space. Yes, it takes up 3D volume in a sense. But if the manifold itself is 2D or flat-like locally, I consider the entire manifold to be 2D. Thus, frames of consciousness are defined as 2D manifolds in this way, requiring and sometimes taking up a 3D volume to exist. Frames can also be literal 2D planar manifolds though, at times, as well.</p>
                <p>This entire principle also applies to 1D manifolds, which I would consider to be a line manifold in a 1D embedding space, or a line or curve manifold in a 2D or 3D embedding space. If the surface is 1D-like at the tiny, local scale, I consider the whole thing 1D. Rings are 1D manifolds in this way, though it is possible for them to require anything from a 1D to a 2D to a 3D embedding space (a ring can be a straight line in very rare cases).</p>

                <p>Originator of the Ring/Bank theory (Dynamic Frame Theory), which proposes that consciousness arises dimensionally. The most incipient processing of stimuli* is their “when” and “how much;” with increased processing time (added latency), this intensity signal (mic voice) is interpreted into low-dimensional 0-2D manifold ringframes (“where,” “what shape”), and with further processing (latency), the ringframes “scratch-to-reveal” content voxels which can auto-complete to a full 3D experience schema (“what,” meaning). In normal state consciousness, the entire heirarchy usually occurs with little latency, and ongoing context helps the volume of experience stay afloat and seem continuous.</p>

                <p>A neuroscientist known for his work on how the brain plans and executes movement. His research on the motor cortex of rhesus monkeys during tasks like cyclic hand movements revealed that neural activity evolves in a complex but highly structured way, following a “rotational dynamic.” His work, using techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), showed that the population of neurons behaves like a dynamical system, generating a predictable neural trajectory that can be visualized as a “ring” in a low-dimensional space. This challenges the older view that individual neurons directly represent muscle commands and instead suggests that movement is generated by an elegant, unified choreography of a large population of neurons. The form of PCA often used by neuroscience could be called <em>FM-PCA</em> (frequency modulation PCA), as it uses the changing frequency of action potentials of single neurons as the axes for PCA consideration. This is in distinction from <em>AM-PCA</em> (amplitude modulation PCA), where variations in amplitude or power of a frequency band are taken as the axes for PCA consideration.</p>

                <p>A cognitive scientist known for his work on the visual system and a <strong>geometric model of consciousness</strong>. Lehar proposes that conscious experience is a <strong>geometric-topological</strong> representation of reality, a kind of internal <strong>virtual reality</strong> created by the brain. His work attempts to explain phenomena like illusions and the nature of qualia by modeling the brain's internal representations. This approach resonates with other dimensional theories, such as the Ring/Bank theory, as both see consciousness as a process of building a structured, dimensional model of the world, rather than a mere collection of disparate neural signals.</p>

This model is based on a hierarchical network of cortical columns, each creating its own complete model of an object or concept. These models are then unified through a voting mechanism to produce a single conscious perception.</p>

He has shown that different aspects of vision, such as color and form, are processed by separate areas of the brain. He argues that our subjective, conscious experience of vision is created by the brain’s ability to bring these disparate signals together to form a unified image of the world.</p>

                <p>An American neuroscientist who conducted groundbreaking experiments on the timing of conscious intention and action. He showed that the brain’s neural activity associated with a voluntary movement (the “readiness potential”) begins before a person consciously decides to move. His work has sparked intense debate on the nature of free will and whether conscious decisions are a cause of action or simply an after-the-fact awareness of a decision already made by the brain.</p>

                <p>A French cognitive neuroscientist who is a leading proponent of the Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT). He uses advanced brain imaging techniques to study how conscious thought differs from unconscious processing. His research suggests that consciousness is not a single location but a specific brain state where information is widely broadcast across a network of cortical neurons, allowing for a flexible and integrated response.</p>
