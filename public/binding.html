  <p>
    The binding problem is a problem you keep running into when exploring mechanisms for consciousness. In your experience, you hear a bird chirp once. But when you
    look in the brain, every region shows different timing and shapes of electrical crests.
  </p>

  <p>
    What makes this more bizarre is that even though visual/auditory/somatic signals arrive with different lags, your conscious experience compensates — welds them —
    to have a single agreed time for every event, even when the event has both visual and somatic components.
    Experience shows no echoes or spread of timing of events — events feel singular. That’s the question: what is the orchestration process, and where in the brain can we see it?
  </p>
    <p>
    The image below shows event-related potentials (ERPs) for somatic, auditory, and visual stimuli- the timing and shape are different.

<h2>1. Anastomotic Processing (Warren McCulloch/IIT)?</h2>
<p>
  <img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/theoriesofconsciousness.appspot.com/o/greenified_warrenMcCulloch.jpg?alt=media&token=e2d9a6fb-b008-432e-a369-27c2db034c18"

  Warren McCulloch was a neuroscientist who proposed the idea of anastomotic processing&mdash;that the brain's main magic is not serial or parallel, but a third
  kind of thing&mdash;a neural network style mixing. If you imagine a net with three layers, input to each node on the bottom layer gets broadcast with differing
  weights to the middle layer, and so on. In this way, you can extract invariant patterns in the input, and perhaps bind several inputs into a singular complex representation.
  Maybe this is what Integrated Information Theory (IIT) is hinting at, that a unitary temporal stream arises by this criss-cross mixing. One might imagine that the coexistence of multiple operating timescales within the network helps forge a unified temporal stream&mdash;with ionotropic receptors generating sharp, millisecond bursts, and metabotropic receptors stretching that same signal into a slow, echoing persistence across seconds.

        <h2>2. Matrix Cell or Other Clock (Rodolpho Llinás/GWT)?</h2>
<p>
    <img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/theoriesofconsciousness.appspot.com/o/greenified_rodolfoLlinas.png?alt=media&token=d7d5530a-492b-4db0-a704-5844108813d2"

         style="float: left; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; height: 140px;" />
    Llinás is another neuroscientist whose book "I of the Vortex" proposes that the thalamus is key in overcoming the binding problem&mdash;to wit, that the 
    thalamus has two types of functions: (1) relaying sensory input, and (2) providing a global, binding, amodal 'clock' signal. Primary (LGN, MGN) and associational (Pulvinar) thalamus
    would do function one; while intralaminar and other matrix cell regions, which broadcast roughly to the whole cortex, would provide the timing of frames of consciousness. Where two signals join
    in time at cortex, this would dictate what is attended to from moment to moment. Bernard Baars' Global Workspace Theory (GWT) suggests frontal or attentional systems may serve as the 
integrating clock. To Baars' point, mPFC (medial prefrontal cortex) does appear to show FM crest response to transients in music, etc. The graphic below demonstrates how matrix cells might clock the brain.

        <h2>3. Inputs, Priors and Posteriors (Jeff Hawkins/Shamil Chandaria/Karl Friston)?</h2>
<p>
    <img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/theoriesofconsciousness.appspot.com/o/greenified_jeffHawkins.jpeg?alt=media&token=c989f041-d0d3-4866-90b0-3d607ce43e7b"

         style="float: left; margin-left: 1em; height: 140px;" />
    Many view the brain as Bayesian (predictive/probabilistic). Hawkins argues more for a sparse encoding model, which resembles higher nodes in McCulloch's neural net theory. 
    His two books, "On Intelligence," and "Thousand Brains Theory," are excellent reads. Chandaria extends Friston's ideas and proposes that sensory inputs are compared against priors and context
    before concluding with an interpretive posterior (your actual experience). This is good as far as it goes, but I feel it does not look enough at phenomenology, because I see no
    accounting for the observation that the worldsim is often refreshed by a revolvic sweep (like a vertical rolodex with 10 cards, all equidistant, and printed one every 100 ms, sweeping
    around the entire deck or volume in 1 second). This refresh is very dynamic (may vary in revolution speed from 1 second to 25 milliseconds, may vary from 10-20 cards, may vary in 3D orientation [isn't always vertical], etc.).
</p>

        <h2>4. Spatial Cyclism?</h2>
        <p>
            My contribution to this discussion is mostly to propose that consciousness is exquisitely orchestrated. That is uses a 'bank' structure (3D agglomerate of concentric cubes/spheres/cylinders) as the binder. 
In normal state, the brain is fairly loosely bound, and several regions use the bank 'locally.' For example, if you use kasina strobe glasses set to 13 Hz in normal state (eyes closed), you 
will likely begin to hallucinate a revolvic print of parallel zigzag lines, which may use alternating colors of purple, green, and white; or purple, orange, light blue, and green (or something else). These colors may sometimes 
be parallel with the lines, or perpendicular to them. I think it is likely that this is the bank schema printhead's behavior being 'lightly seen' in normal state. That is, 
you do not feel the zigzags, but you do at least see them.
        </p>
        <p>In sedation (or sleep deprivation), the brain becomes hyperpolarized, setting up a global burst mode. It becomes harder for inputs to get through, but if they are 
strong enough and/or timed with the crests of the system, they gain global broadcast. It is a state of heightened, but time-division access, attention. In this state, the entire higher order/associational brain must use a 
singular instance of the bank. Now, if you entrain with kasina strobe glasses, you may feel the rotation of the bank printing 
the zigzags. You observe a singular 'mic' of transients which encode one qualia at a time. You observe the worldsim may be refreshed by standing cards or by a revolvic sweep of cards. 
This shows that consciousness is highly orchestrated, and certain 'apple slices' of your modeling space get cyclic time-division access to being printed, perhaps somewhat holographically, in the sense that you can 
deduce the full 3D 'paint' video intended merely from the slice touch points.
