<h2>Ring Theory Solves the Binding Problem</h2>

<p>This site is actually devoted to one theory of consciousness, but there are multiple proposed components of consciousness, and each may have one or many possible theories of its own. The main theory is that "rings" underlie the feeling of all the qualia (sound, taste, pain, accomplishment, self, and possibly sight) and serve generally as a focal tool. This theory is laid out in the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rings-Fire-Brain-Makes-Consciousness/dp/B0B5RWKQ3Y">"Rings of Fire: How the Brain Makes Consciousness,"</a> by Brad Caldwell. A <a href="https://youtu.be/YFj0Vapvdc4">video</a> explaining the basics is available also. I am convinced that this theory solves the main "binding problem" of how disparate qualia can be unified, as I have experienced it in a profound way, where all the qualia started and stopped together, and I could see how they, seemingly disparate, can arise from inertial feelings.</p>

<p>Not only did I experience rings, I saw the thing that "prints" them. If you imagine that the scenery around you is printed by a giant cube matrix of 3D points, you get an idea. I think the reason I could see the structure of this "bank" is because it was "leaky" and leaking "consciousness ink" out slightly from several of the most oft-used 3D shapes within it. While the bank (shown in image below) is usually two feet cubed, it can readily grow to miles cubed for large scenes. In reality, the "bank" is not this perfect, and incorporates millions of everyday items in the translucent shape/skin collection, not just sphere shells and cube shells. Everything (shape-wise) you've stored is in the bank.</p>

<p>This "ring" theory also says that, like a movie, much of what the brain does in creating the seemingly smooth experience of consciousness is actually made with several static or spaced components. In other words, there are frequencies to aspects of consciousness. Focus seems to be a ring varying from 2 Hz to 14 Hz, but the "frames" it uses have "movified" paint on them - the visual colored part is a movie within the short frame - and each frame is joined so perfectly that you get tricked into believing the "movie" is all there is. The "movie" of colors has a higher frequency (100 Hz?) and perhaps the voxels at different spatial locations are randomized in phase for even more smoothness. Someone with Parkinson's may be able to notice these focal frames, as their jerky motions may bewray imperfectly smooth transitions between focal frames.</p>

<p>There are two basic "worlds" within consciousness. The first is what I call the "Sensory Physical World." If you just look at your visual surroundings (but include your body and the location of sounds you are hearing), that is the "Sensory Physical World" (SPW). It isn't the real world, but it does a very good job of modeling it! That world that seems real to you is merely the handiwork of your brain painting what it thinks the world must be like. The second "world" of consciousness is one you know, but don't know that you know. It is called the "Cartoon Motor World" (CMW), and is basically your focus or imagination. Like the SPW, it is a realm of 3D skins that can move over time (sort of like a 3D movie), but the skins in this world are usually about 1/10th the size, and are translucent (no color). They are also nearly subconscious, and usually more felt than viewed. Nevertheless, they carry the meaning and info of more abstract qualia that cannot be represented by the SPW alone.</p>
<p>When you hear someone begin talking, your CMW springs into action depicting the actions and objects described by the speech, or depicting the person talking. You can't hear something and not start drawing these meaning-depictions in animated 3D translucent skins. If you hit your thumb with a hammer, your CMW will paint a 3D translucent skin movie of you getting your thumb smashed, or it glowing red with pain, and "fly" you against time and provide inertial hits and vibrations that fully depict the feeling of your pain. As long as the back half of the brain paints consciousness clearly enough for the front half ("you") to be able to ascertain the meaning therein, that's all that's needed.</p>
<p>So, this "ring"/"helix" (which perhaps if a later, more grown phase is emphasized, could assume some 3D skin such as spherical, raised-relief-topo, or objectified) can serve not only as the portal between switching brain perception models between SPW and CMW, but as the portal between "presentation" (perceptual model) and contemplation and/or "action" (driving the motor responses). All your movements may be driven at the top level of consciousness by this helix. After all, the top level of consciousness shouldn't have to worry about the intricacies of movement (unless it is learning something new, in which case consciousness is given access to low-level things like precise finger movement) - it should be able to merely "know" what motor plan it wants to implement and have the rest of the brain "read its mind." It can do this if sub-regions work from the bottom up and just present the head of the motor plan to the PFC as an abstract thing, and if every region of the brain has to use the ring/helix as a unifying, spatial and temporal reference. If you focus in on one instantaneous moment, then an infinitesimal phasic distance on the helix is merely a point somewhere in perceptual space. The "ring" or "helix" becomes a "3D cursor" at the right level of temporal zooming in.</p>

<p>Perhaps both worlds (SPW, CMW) are made by "flying" a 2D outline against the "flow" of time as a third axis. At least the CMW is often made this way. You "view" by experiencing the things on the ring. The plane of the ring can "3D rotate." "Now" perturbations can be cyclically precessed or lagged very precisely by a few milliseconds to create both the sense of "flow" and by changing cyclic precession or lag phasically, you can draw 3D translucent skins. If a sound is axially offset from the ring, place it "artificially" a little too soon so as to get on a different ring, but at same phasic location, so as to "draw" the proper axial distance needed. In this way, you "barter with time," and use actual time distortions as a "wink wink" way of saying "imagine that there's a canvas flowing at 10 m/s and the phasic and cyclic distortions I use are painting the actual meaning of the sound, with the sound"!</p>

<p>I am awaiting permission to include this in a video or in my book, but the article on <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7553818/">Deep Posteromedial Cortical Rhythms in the Brain</a> is great, and I would recommend clicking to download supplemental videos 1 and 2. Also, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=7553818_nihms-1634078-f0012.jpg">this chart</a> within the site is amazing, showing how neural spike trains go form smooth to "cyclified" and "dissociated" after Ketamine.</p>

<h2>Perceptuo-Spatio-Genesis Theories to Address the Spatial Problem</h2>
<p>The second biggest problem I see regarding consciousness is how 3D spatial meaning can be created. I call this the "spatial problem." If you grant that the bank is how scenes in space are printed, then there is no spatial problem. But, the fact is, even this bank must come to have spatial meaning in the first place, so how does it get its space? There seems to be no "neurospatial" mechanism available in the brain to paint the things you see in daily life in an accurate 3D form. So it seems that some other method may be used by the brain for creating perceptual space, whether using amplitude or frequency modulation to somehow inflate 3D space, whether letting two patterns "piggyback" off each other, or whether pairing neural activity to actual movement in a meaningful way.</p>

<h2>Many Ideas Regarding the Mechanisms/Correlates Problems</h2>
<p>There is also the question of is the view of consciousness presented to a viewer for contemplation and action. Is this "viewer" the prefrontal cortex? Or the thalamus/basal ganglia? Is there an "awillic" version of consciousness generated by the retrosplenial cortex which requires no action but merely cinematic viewing of the story of self?</p>
<p>As you descend downward from "normal" consciousness further into these weeds, things split up more and more into little regions of the brain. Trying to understand which brain region does what, and what the specific mechanisms for "making consciousness" are gives rise to nearly endless theories, at least until one comes along that is satisfactory.</p>

<h2>What Is Sleep?</h2>
When you fall asleep, GABA is released into the prefrontal cortex to inhibit it. As shown in <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0901435106">this study</a>, the back half of the brain, or the posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and angular gyri portion of the DMN (Default Mode Network), possibly the driver of the CMW imagination 10 HZ frames, lose their node in the medial frontal cortex during deep sleep. Could this front node be used to frequently get the CMW to model the SPW so as to tether you to the outside world? Then perhaps the CEN (Central Executive Network) mode might drive the 40-100 Hz frames of the SPW. The SN (Salience Network) could act as the toggling switch. Since DMN (CMW?) and CEN (SPW?) have varying levels of anti-correlation, at complete anti-correlation (one on means the other completely off), the brain would be showing one 1/40th second flick of CMW followed by one 1/40th second flick of SPW (has been experientially observed). When both are active, "you" could be paying some level of attention to both simultaneously, such as when CMW spatially overlaps SPW. Anyway, as you fall asleep, you lose the SPW, and the CMW conscribes the "where path" for use in making dreams (imagination) appear to be the only reality. So, falling asleep is essentially the mapping of all incoming stimuli to fit within what you're currently thinking about, rather than their actual source.
