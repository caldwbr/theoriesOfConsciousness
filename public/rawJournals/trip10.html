<h1>Raw Journals: Trip 10</h1>

<p>The following are notes from 10/5/22 (taking a bite of a legal delta-0 hemp gummy) and extra filler added later in contemplation. The reason there are typos is because I swiped it all out with my finger on my iPhone as quickly as I could and didn't want to lose thoughts by going back when iPhone keyboard was being stupid. Some of the things I can no longer tell exactly what word I was going for, so I'm leaving the text alone. I think the most philosophical thought can be gotten from it that way. I add filler here and there to help provide context/meaning. These notes should be taken in a philosophical way - I write everything down that comes to mind without checking it; then I can check and consider the things later. Thus, statements that appear as fact may be me looking at something a certain way and trying it on, but it doesn't mean that I fully agree with it. These notes are more like grasping to try to understand consciousness and just things in general.<br>

<br>
Considering the word "euthanized," you're not even seeing or focusing on all sub skewers but they're there if you need to move there like peripheral vision.<br>
<br>
Boards twice the angular width at base. Eye and brain might use angular x and angular y and radius z. Higher level of brain may be able to abstract about distances in regular x and y and z.<br>
<br>
Remember that allocentric bank is just that - allocentric. To hold outside world steady. The real time movements of the eye (rotations)<br>
<br>
Reading a letter or word or phrase seems to be a rolling event. Sphere not cube. Well the screen of phone can be cube plane.<br>
<br>
35 minutes in and NOTHING to report ðŸ˜©<br>
<br>
10:50 (hour in) relaxed but no geometries. is pissed.<br>
<br>
The things that you DO are more important (in story) - like goals - like things with grandma growing up that you talked. Like having a life and normal friends. Not the physical skins (you've forced it to be part of your story!) so much!<br>
<br>
If you're talking with grandma and telling her your life honestly cause she asks prying questions - that is the story. Yes it paints the world that the character is in for ducks sake but the point is the story. This is why paint (color) is supplementary, but not required.<br>
<br>
When you make your story all about the skins (what you currently see), you've lost having a life. There needs to be humor, keeping spirits alive, inclusion (he does do that).<br>
<br>
Grandma, John (and grandad) had more life than anyone.<br>
<br>
Maybe the cortical layers have a little purpose but aren't magical. Maybe subsets of cells are more important.<br>
<br>
Even when I lost my will, I was still forced to experience the life story.<br>
<br>
0.2 seconds to respond to gunshot sound - 40 ms more to respond to light.<br>

Hannah saw h as red, a as orange, n as grey blue; but they fade into, like a sunset in that word.<br>

Not a lot <br>
Think : ring needn't be planar. By having ring can also have wonky "intersection plane" ie bent and tortuous topo<br>
(self) Knowing distances is a part of story.<br>
You think looking thru your eyes is important in creation of consciousness - no, because you exist at (are hypnotized are tricked are seduced are cinema) level of meaning of story - you actually believe it! You actually believe that is reality when it is mere brain trickery creation, even the You! You believe you are really in it when that is the character. The viewer is the alien you call mind's eye <br>
<br>
If so, at least humans tricked aliens into their use by helping preserve their species. If the brain uses frequencies etc that they can see and are fooled into believing the story so as to care and make wise decisions as if (fooled) into thinking this story that they exist as human in this body.<br>
<br>
What if consciousness is fundamentally just what meaning feels like. The meaning presented to pfc.<br>
<br>
Maybe pfc is allowed to respond to what it interprets the meaning to be, so that meaning, abstract, exists and doesn't exist, in the (synaptic?) interchange between highest sense and highest act. In the story there is this extra third dimension where I can scratch neck while transverse ring only intersects a little of hand but in story it is conveyed so as to be convincing and thus felt in 3d along whole swath of neck.<br>
<br>
Slight jerk of knees leftward can be put on sagittal rings.<br>
<br>
In the story the world stays solid spatially spin-lock AGU. <br>
<br>
The story even controls what he's doing - I can flail my arms to show something that wasn't planned like I'm not just some automaton- (a reaction to the abstract image of the idea that there is no will if brain is machine only in narrow) the sayer of this is in control of the muscles of the real universe body of the character in the perceptual story creation. It (meaning, viewer of story) both has control and draws image of itself obeying its commands.<br>
The thing in control is responding to the abstract meaning of the story <br>
Whatever movements of character in story against ring at that moment what forces would be exerted ie distance shifts of parts of body carrying or updating paint on ring that is what is needed to enact (communicate) movement. That's just one of the patterns used that's kinda neat.<br>
Putting a little feeling (uncomfortable vibration) between eyes and backward to hand meant the application of pressure by hand and scrunchING hair. A lag to draw on part of ring can state distance of future thing when it does show up how much later than on time stuff.<br>
Your eyes look back thru your head when put hand on back of head.<br>
<br>
If you can teach it to adjust the character's response within the story by forces to ring that direct character in a certain way. Making adjustments to character by adjusting the ring into the future. Then you force patterns to paint something but more importantly you force patterns to mean certain actions. Both changes it ("your response") as desired, and views in real time the changes.<br>
Coronal wonky paper circles at left hand then over and up then reverse on self and come down to chest. It's allowed!<br>
The story within is the important part but hey you're seduced down there most the time anyhow!<br>
Can change attitude a lot quickly like head right left right in one second might be ten frames rings and go thru all the angles of coronal sagittal transverse.<br>
Unbreak my heart speaker ring CMW more visible but smaller, flow is down and to right (away from speaker flow of sound); fainter but bigger ring can simultaneously draw shoulder and etc of body when moving around. By lagging (staying in plane), or by warping ring.<br>
Maybe the scrunching or stretching is to filter the constituent parts of audio for pfc to see the audio ascribed to right part.<br>
<br>
U can look at it as a 2d flat photo or as a 3d face.<br>
<br>
You can abstract away any time you want via mind's eye sweep off. Thus you can view Brad in world, but you can also view your mind's eye viewing him.<br>
<br>
Do higher frequencies shoot the fabric thru faster like breathing thru nostrils faster than bounces of hand on bed.<br>
<br>
Midnight purr seems to be rippling the center of sagittal/coronal ring with flow going off up to right.<br>
<br>
Leaning in bed  on right side rings coming down or partial spheres they were drawing CMW of bex saying thinking same thing of will this stalker ever cease (sagittal to head), and they had a spot in SPW but SPW wasn't needed there in those frames as I had the thought of what if Bex therefore karma. Then SPW as they came lower and I returned to my self on the bed in real life. It impacted at a max then ceased (maybe my head rolling and stopping), so a little nice inertia stuff thrown in too. Whole thing there is about one second or two.<br>
<br>
Any spot on helix (well, current spot) is the whole of the battle between incoming and outgoing and changes. <br>
<br>
<br>
10/7/22 raspberry lemonade 8s?<br>
The bank doesn't have to be a perfect cube - kinda like a peach, with one (right) vertical leg the bottom is pulled in at base. Also like Georgia. Has leg below. Could be brainstem and pons if neurospatial? No. Because turning head doesn't turn bank.<br>
<br>
Eyes open _ driving was jarring because over 3 rings had to bring internal model into alignment cause road had sunk down in model.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Could distance be a meaning? Built relative to the structure and size of the human body? And of the steps and time duration to get somewhere? <br>
<br>
Thalamus (Indian video):<br>
1. Anterior (&LD):<br>
Papez Circuit (Emotion, Learning, Memory)<br>
Mammillary Bodies -> (Anterior) Thalamus (&LD) -> Cingulate -> Parahippocampal Gyrus -> Mammillary Bodies <br>
Fibers: Mammillo-thalamic, subthalamic radiations, cingulum, fornix<br>
Loss of ant-> Korsakoff's syndrome <br>
2. Medial (dorsal)(MD):<br>
Reciprocal connections with amygdala, PFC, other thalamic nuclei <br>
3. Intralaminar & Midline nucleus:<br>
Inputs from ARAS <br>
4. Lateral posterior:<br>
Reciprocal connections with LGN, MGN, SC, other thalamic nuclei. Projects to superior parietal lobule (association area).<br>
5. Pulvinar:<br>
Reciprocal connections with LGN, MGN, and association areas of temporal, of occipital, and of parietal.<br>
6. Ventral Anterior & Ventral Lateral:<br>
Basal ganglia & cerebellum project here to affect motor output from motor cortex. VA has projections from pallidus and substantia nigra. Ventral Lateral receives fibers from substantia nigra and globus pallidus, but more specifically, from dentate of cerebellum.<br>
7. Ventral Posterior (Medial & Lateral):<br>
VPL gets spinal and medial lemnisci (pain, touch, proprioception, vibration, temp) from body; VPM gets taste and trigeminal lemniscus (pain, touch, proprioception, vibration, temp) from neck and face/head. Lateral lemniscus has audio and goes to inferior colliculus. <br>
<br>
Insta-> prolly ID, ID positive, prior to "that shot I took in cave" -> almost like the structure of that 4-pane with those shots the skin was matched prior to even the understanding of the meaning (prior to onion layers looked upon for meaning.<br>
<br>
Insta-> ID  by _ in image, within ~1/40th of a second! ID with probability that fast, looked further to verify and have 100% confidence.<br>

<br>
Devote a pattern to various degrees of axes, multiple axes, not just x y z but inbetween ones. In visual cortex.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The pfc is looking at all these patterns and incoming like feeling fingers on book for cap and recognizing instantly - it knew (is reading feed in real time) touches and which personal finger. When you say you know your fingers well, the pfc knows your fingers well. The pfc reader and decider is you! It doesn't see data from fingers as data -> it sees it as OK cap must be there cause these fingers are being raised in this place in space, and there's piano and book of structure to get to that spot. Like the pfc has not necessarily working memory, but near instantaneous identification of anything, at its fingertips. So that what feels like you is the PFC deciding how to handle everything. It gets just the lower level stuff when id of item is uncertain, but quickly building things it could be.<br>
<br>
What if somehow PHZ isss the viewer "pfc" viewing the SPW? But I think not, since there are a heirarchy of views being sent to pfc and feedback back. Maybe the feedback back controls the motor movement to see what it (pfc) wants? So that during wake, "you" (pfc) are in control. Why (how?) does the 10 Hz inhibition alpha wave control things?<br>
<br>
And since pfc is heavily shut down by thc, maybe that is why high feels like sleep or like awillic or easy viewer only. Maybe it brings out (falls back upon) the more intuitive, harder ingrained currents in pfc. Less second guessing, but less fine ability.<br>
<br>
Maybe lingual(no, precuneus) region guides dreams like it is the you when asleep.<br>
<br>
Posterior cingulate cortex seems to deal with SPW. When you meditate or mind-wander, PCC deactivates. When you have S__ P_____ or life up your ass, it activates (forces you to deal with "urgent" real world stuff).<br>
<br>
Default mode network (DMN) sounds like CMW; central executive network (CEN) sounds like SPW; salience network (SN) (SSN SomatoSensoryNetwork) could be both switch between the two, and functional (not neurospatial) site of rings, with anterior insula repping the incoming part of ring, and anterior cingulate cortex repping the outgoing motor or CHANGE aspect of ring.<br>
<br>
What we call background consciousness is just incoming feed that isn't currently needed used by pfc in affecting motor output!!!!!<br>
<br>
How can background color be reduced to a what when it seems so qualitative?<br>
<br>
Is the helical ring nubbed over time structure able to have this new phenomenon that universal consciousness can read it?<br>
<br>
Gaps cause it to twist. Phasic gaps (inhibition) can introduce 3d rotation of attitude. Like inhibition could act on axial offset?<br>
<br>
Cerebellum axons charge is radially inward of spherical shell, but also that whole shell is radially inward.<br>
<br>
What if (PFC/TEMP/)cerebellum is CMW, brainstem coordinates rings, (PHZ)cerebrum is SPW?<br>
<br>
What if cortical waves -> "the ring is present upon SPW"?<br>
<br>
Could perceptual space and color be meaning?<br>
<br>
Chart of apply TCS what hallucination including PHZ, angular gyrus (dissociation from body), posterior (?) insula (visceral)..... Part of Pfc, can heal social unfair disadvantage. With footnote of source.<br>
<br>
What you think is your body looking at the world is really your pfc looking at the PHZ. At least functionally maybe not neurospatially.<br>
<br>
Add networks on off to sleep wake chart. Like apparently DMN is default because it is focal (CMW)(?), and is active also in sleep (checks).<br>
<br>
What if you have to force consciousness to keep going or like robot it would stop?<br>
<br>
Pure Meaning seems to exist at the infinitesimal zero conic degree angle skewer. Perhaps even with story (consciousness) this is true. Is the perfect meaning, that we can never quite get to, God, the sum of all lessons?<br>
<br>
Why the hell are they concerned about "task's" effect on brain networks? That's NOT the main point of consciousness and it is not the major dichotomy, which is rather SPW/CMW.<br>
<br>
PCC prolly correlated with CMW (and episodic memory!)(and envisioning the future!). PPC (Posterior Parietal Cortex [lateral]) prolly correlated with SPW.<br>
<br>
Anti-correlation b/w CEN and DMN is not absolute:<br>
<br>
<br>
Bitch don't say you don't like sex unless you really don't I've never met anyone <br>
<br>
It feels like "you" can move your eyes around. This is the pfc frontal eye fields. <br>
<br>
Is the letter chasm in bank thing part of brain giving pfc options for episodic frame video snips to watch to link and give meaning? Does meaning come from memory and thus from this assemblage of several frames of various memory scenes of inertial changes to geometrical forms? The "aspect in common between skewered items"? This would allow letter skewers at zero conic degree to be the actual meaning of the letter -> a geometrical symbol!<br>
<br>
Viewing things (farther things smaller) is a tool for sampling and reacting. Farther things smaller relative to an observer at some distance is a fact of geometry. Of spheric putting-offs, like charge does (like "stationary" electron). The further away from observer, the larger size the shell it is on, and the smaller conic degree angle.<br>
<br>
I guess there can be an iso-sizic construction without a viewer - that's the physical universe.<br>
<br>
So does bank do hallway iso-sizic with viewer, or does it build viewer in by making size variable so as to focus a viewer into existence?<br>
<br>
The "you" isn't some ethereal force that can do as it wants (tho it seems so), it is the functioning of pfc which "can do what it wants" um explore this later? Too complex atm!<br>
<br>
The interesting thing is that there is a brain "left" to interpret "consciousness" - the (medial?) pfc (/insula?)! Cause temporal lobe (+sensorimotor) can handle CMW and PHZ can handle SPW!<br>
<br>
Is freedom the fact that we can ignore commands and choose to base off earlier commands or self created commands?<br>
<br>
When you move around, not only does bank paint you moving, but it must paint change in distance between left side of window and wall.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It kind of makes sense to have iso-sizic models since as you grow things seem to shrink. But I guess that could be done with vario-sizic (better, warpo-sizic) also.<br>
<br>
Which sphere is this pixel on to convert to voxel. !!!!!!!.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Is it possible for real meaning to exist in a universe that is temporary? Jim on movie Passengers says his purpose as mechanic is helping build this new civilization (structures), but they will eventually be gone, then what is the stability or permanence of that?<br>
<br>
Eyes closed it has more trouble staying online super high like the reduction in cortical activity gamma waves hurts ability to stay online like you'll conch out.<br>
<br>
FILLER: EO helps to stabilize the wake state.<br>
<br>
Gamma waves of eyes open prolly make it easy to fall into believing that world rather than look at rings or ring rate.<br>
<br>
If it can draw a really good cartoon from side view, so be it (attitudinal slice). Mind's eye view point.<br>
<br>
Maybe flow is cause that world loses its bearings. Two fingers two toes wiggle makes coffin ring, flow down. I thot flow was another way and ring until just now got high enough.<br>
<br>
My Mom went from someone (Dad) that really spoke up and took responsibility and cared about kids raising to someone (Tom) too insecure and felt untotempolable to tell me or Emily anything. "Help your Mom do so and so." Honestly seems like a reaction from the too much control of one to the weak duckling of another.<br>
<br>
This isn't bad!<br>
<br>
Look at screen blip. Close eyes image ramps down then boom a afterclap of grey to abort what can't survive. But still the fetus tries to live and it's like the gobbledy-gooky monster getting shot on intellivision. At one point looking at phone it was like a kitty play ring the visual image going gobbledy-gooky shooting away from me and to left along kitty play ring. I think those might be fucked up gamma waves. Head may need to be sideways to better see the gobbledy. The grey smearing out comes from left to right impact this time.<br>
<br>
You could also compare the greying out to a noise gate. Without sufficient eye input, kill off the occipital cortex feed!<br>
<br>
"Abortion" (killing off of visual paint when shutting eyes) seems to be a fairly inertial event. Well, sometimes (depending where on phase of what of this invisible monster?).<br>
<br>
As you rock head from left to right, coronal (changing tilt left to then tilt right) rings can offset each other as part of the motion of head turning (as you turn your head, divide into 3 or 4 snapshots). Left ring tilt outline face there. Change in head location and tilt (not perfect with other ring tilt) in story. As move across, changing attitude but over time. So that three outlines won't jive with your static body and face, but with the movie object you.<br>
<br>
Ring can change attitude drastically for your stupid wonk acts to test me (ring theory) (flail arms to try to prove predestination or lack of will isn't true; but alas, even it was planned), but Maybe not as you think. <br>
<br>
The brain must use actual future or pastness to paint spatial distance of that last lost axis as a flow flows across!!!!!!!! Two fingers twirking were on ring and on that plane. Two toes twirking the twirk down must be painted sooner and later because altho on ring, offset axially in lost dimension both sides. Because in time it is correct. It's like the meaning derived helps you know it is trying to create motion flow for time flow and still paint that dimension. It's a precession and postcession. <br>
<br>
If you use precession and postcession to flow in a particular "direction", you can have different directions and speeds for various things like inertial toe scrunch vs sound vs color.<br>
<br>
Draw your helix scaffold serpent over time and fill your story into <br>
<br>
Penguin cut out (side transverse) Penguin head to ceilingward. Rings come from butt to head as focus on which inertial changes moves up. Penguin cause you're thinking something about them. Dual purpose CMW and SPW. Note also, rings often move in real world 1' going from feet to head, and this separate rings can really be a spiral helix at finer temporal examination. Your attention is tracer. But it often isn't exactly 3d where you think it is especially the depth direction off current ring plane.<br>
FILLER: I was thinking of penguins, so CMW ring was outline of penguin, but the real world was getting painted or supplied paint by these penguin shaped rings. But penguin rings over time were changing shape and moving to bewray that it is a penguin 3D MOVIE.<br>
<br>
Because over time you know snapshots of it (forget color for a second). But even color could be fast enough peeling off rings! And front or back of ring could be drawn or emphasized and not so much the other. "Peeling off" because new ring is at New physical spot in overlay of SPW and then next ring further and next ring further and eventually is turns and comes back but by then the past rings have faded. There's your focus and there's Brad's body's eyes' focus.GREY/BLACK TEXT NOW over black color brown now f of for black now just cross hair of for black now just the stylus of f black. c of because grey now black.<br>
<br>
Christmas - not a lot of meaning this time.<br>
<br>
As coronal rings go out from head (move in physical space of SPW, then restart or turn or however or fade), they can fade in intensity and in what need be drawn cause I'm not concerned with that blackness up there (lights off) eyes closed!<br>
<br>
Fly with me - I THINK higher frequency noise "travels faster" (flow) (let sounds precess meaning of sound origin 3d movie characters)(say there's faster flow for that frequency and precess accordingly and as needed to paint the 3D sound story CMW!!!)!!!! HAVE to bring whole ring attitude change (update what slice you're painting!) to correct past. It's an (over time) SPW-recordable-movement in story.<br>
<br>
FILLER: The below is about "aborting" the remnant of visual scene out of existence right after closing eyes (dies in about half a second or way less):<br>
Heart beat 1: EO, EC, fade down <br>
Heart beat 2: Abortion explosion white outline around screen <br>
10 heart beats in 9 seconds <br>
<br>
Ring (sagittal) can reverse course to show inertia top then bottom then top of bank again before proceeding on. Any kind of (SPW/REAL WORLD) movement stop start rotation. Why the "helix" (not that pretty always) can have axial.<br>
<br>
What if it were that we were all (consciousnesses) white holes?<br>
FILLER: Getting philosophical to the point of weird: The idea above is that what if black holes are compressing matter to the point that energy breaks through counterspatially into another universe (the one we're in), and life figured out how to tap that energy, and it rides along with the physical universe at same time rate, but is felt. Something like that.<br>
<br>
The ring thing isn't such a brain secret - just know attitude and do one transform to get you info on any other plane. Like do muscles have to pay attention? No. A sideways meaning ring has a 3d motor plan to acheive it, via learned patterns of that ring with that attitude with that learned behavior. The motions of your hands on bed is just something you've learned to do. Could hipp translate between 3d commands (really, all inclusive demands- nothing really 3d about the commanding patterns) and 2d rings and even 1d cursor and back again? <br>
<br>
Point of no return - you jive your body to same beats drummer beats drum I mean same tempo for like motions. Moving with, become one. CMW and SPW in concert of tempo for drawn motion of Brad (SPW) and styx (CMW).<br>
<br>
SOUND seems concentrated on spot on ring in this case of iPhone small speaker but ring still big. Like higher notes flow is faster. Flow is the motion over time that must be assumed from precession used in order to paint 3D movie objects.<br>
<br>
The bank is probably the TOOL for determining precession amount needed to generate right flow or whatever.<br>
<br>
Identify what in time is touching ring, so scratching head which fingers and where on finger, and then where it is actually in space is use bank as tool. Like light up the neurons repping meaning of what ring is touching. And even that could precess and thus show flow for parts of body axially offset (serves two purposes!).<br>
<br>
This stick: Take the ants out of your pants but not lazy a calm sanity increase in social discernment.<br>
<br>
Show person their mri in real time while talking listening to music etc high seeing rings.<br>
<br>
For any brain region to know how to draw via precession, it must know the 3d spatial attitude changes of ring and know how to update.<br>
<br>
Color (the brush) is so fast (?) that you focus on that painted rather than the painting, but it seems to be a very fast stroke swush.<br>
<br>
Dream. Cone buzz shock tool. Tower with shingle sample boards and books at top. Two _s. At beach. <br>
<br>
So I'd say that trip you learned the spatially moving rings, and precession/postcession. Still what is means of spatiogenesis?<br>
<br>
What I don't get with precession is if the ring is drawn by temporal (time) phasism, then wouldn't precession of one object on ring also move it to improper place phasically on ring? Or is it like really fast rings where on first passes it draws that thing and later passes it draws other things. Plus, remember that the object is moving over time. So yea, it is places the precession meaningful onto a quite fast ring (wave), it should be doable.<br>
<br>
It's like the precision within one ring is more important or harder to get right, but cyclic precision should be easier.<br>
<br>
I think consciousness has to be in a single recurrent loop somewhere. If it were spatially separated groups of neurons, you'd need a key for segregating your neurons from the neurons of the pfc of your friend when their forehead is bumped against yours! So, what are the sine que nons of consciousness that we know of? Brainstem (nuclei), Thalamus, PHZ. Possibly something in PFC and or insula. The interesting thing is, thalamus can bind a lot of stuff into one circuit. Maybe it's this circuit plus the episodic memory store and muscular ability store and default mode network and cen store that makes it feel like you. The same circuit in J_____ feels like J_____. What noises could be. What people you're mostly interacting with. What if will is biologically forced? Ie motion is forced and a filter of survival is forced, thus asking for building efficiency filters to acheive this? What if, instead of raw survival (most important tho still), there are a plethora of homeostasis filters (need for fun, need for food, need for good smells, need for education, need for money, need for sex, need for social inclusion, etc)? Some biological; some created in life as a means to a greater filter.<br>
<br>
If we ignore color for a sec and just focus on focal 10Hz(++):<br>
There need be nothing actually spatial about the layout of neurons. Chronospatiogenesis is sufficient - the meaning that it is a cursor at various spots over time which incidentally trace rings (phasic precession/postcession); AND the very flow of different worlds and the 3D movie skins of each (being done by cyclic precession/postcession) - both can be done solely by CSG. And what they're painting is the skin boundaries as they move over time!! Which means the only thing left to explain is color!!!!! The rings for toe scrunch seem to require 20-40 Hz. Rings to carry colored skin boundaries may need to be 100+ Hz. Could make sense for 10, 100 Hz brain waves to carry these things, not neurospatially, but integration wise. Oh, and one other thing is how is the viewer made? Like for viewing CMW and SPW at same time. Maybe there's a viewer flow? Spatial position of ring done via piggyback. BANK may just be printing highly used internal models that aren't meant to be printed ever in that agglomerated mass form. This internal model store could be leaking from cerebellum. Why the front half communicates with cerebellum but not much the back half still doesn't make sense unless back half wants to build entire skin and send to pfc prior to saving as helpful.<br>
<br>
Maybe that you feel consciousness is the only hallucinated part.<br>
<br>
"It isn't what they call rock and roll" remembered in a near instant, prior to them singing "it ain't what they call rock and roll"- but meaning captured.<br>
<br>
Sound vibrations are carried by flow to create CMW skins. Perhaps light vibrations are carried by glow to create colored SPW skins?<br>
<br>
What if as you're going around hotel ring your bumping into six different speed cursors one for inertia one for sound one for sight (multiple occurrences on ring due to 40Hz vs 10Hz)?!!!!! Or that ring samples from those other that could even be 2000+ Hz.<br>
<br>
But you can still see background 3d and move your attention cursor anywhere, which corresponds to angular movement in spheric shell 2D.<br>
<br>

With bank, you don't need freaking formulas to understand curves in 3d space such as pumpkin grooves.<br>

Wake is increased distractability.<br>

Dreams -> palace castle thing with tons of rooms and up and down a few stairs. Somebody's marriage. Water parks.peed on towels. Dad came on one trip. He had fun cause I. Little kid that could pop enough balloons to fall but not get hurt. Ducks eating set on fire fish to get car engines going. Mall with a store selling food and delta 9 gummies. <br>
<br>
As I awoke, it seemed the story of the dream was how to paint the awake understanding of Annie's (dance) personality.<br>
<br>
All the rings are is a rule for that region of brain of how to paint. It is a means of dividing time into grosser (cycles) and finer (phases) divisions that serve the purpose of providing a time window and that axial dimension as well as ringular.<br>
<br>
Purely depressing things cannot have existence in time.<br>
<br>

<br>
It's fitting that sound and inertia (mvmt) be produced by same basic mechanism in consciousness since their listening organ the "snail" pairs them. Physically similar too.<br>
<br>
Looking has inertia at spots in story - coronal at head rings going down to table looking at phone - drops over 7 rings to table level and impacts (rings dissipate and change course). The "look" impacted.<br>
<br>
If you don't tease this world(revealed by high- the actual nature of consciousness) open at the ring seam, you'll never see the ring or this world clearly - it will just seem ineffable - even high!<br>
<br>
The SPW is a story just as much as Story (CMW) is. In fact, SPW may seem faker since it is acting so much like it is the real world, but actually a fabrication of brain. SPW gets laid down (temporally on/off) along CMW. Consciousness is the final pass showing to PFC for real time input. The meaning inherent in the actions is consciousness.<br>
PFC - PHZ communicate via a shared temporal code which means spiral and with flow etc.<br>
<br>
Time must be given (object held in existence) for meaning to have meaning. Ultimate obscurity. Except that God may hold the meaning of all in infinitesity. <br>
<br>
Meaning arises from the sufficient info and the self control on the meaning via whatever (inhibition?) (can't roll ball all in one - how you interpret and affect it) is the origin of self-consciousness. Perhaps reality can be tricked via magnetic pulse (less access to hippocampus right now for IDing scientific name, but frees me up to be more creative and novel). No meaning in magnetic pulse hallucination, but brain thot so. Coronal slices showing image (same plane) of "really want to have sex with r c" and layer slices up about axis at top line of computer. This ring can print CMW or SPW at later by 2-5 rings. That's why it's the portal - it's the print head shared in common between them - can print 2d, rings, 3d video objects like toe curl.<br>
You can feel his forces on inertia over some rings or you can hone in on the durations that paint forces of Inertia in story (CMW) and feel it's forces. Ring can step from 2' Dia sagittal to 5' diameter parasag to 50' diameter coronal to grab person on kiddie bike.<br>
<br>
Maybe sound creates rings as it needs to make sounds intermittently and according to complex frequencies thereof. Not 2000 Hz steady, but as needed, add sound in way that assumes there are rings going around at some rate 2000 Hz or whatever, and adjust phase within that tiny one cycle accordingly.<br>
<br>
Can you create the 3d scene just by the fact you know it? And included in knowing of spiral draw.l<br>
<br>
Maybe meaning has a super high freq and gets included in neural messages. Like it is em radiation way higher than detectable. Like everything gives off meaning vibrations like a kind of light.<br>
As horizontal rings are kicked out about axis along in front of body centerline, you (Physical head MODEL) can turn eyes to look at one ring as it gets paster before focusing on present ring again (called getting lost in thot lol!!). (Or if my eyes were closed, mind's eye can look up at paster). Maybe look at saccades for 4 eye saccades in same direction as frame rate and doing this?<br>
<br>
Eeg looked like jumps up were inertial points temporally on ring.<br>
Whatever command would bring ring intersection point (of arm spot) up.<br>
<br>
All they (Halsey) are is high and therefore sufficiently vulnerable to be resonant.<br>
<br>
High sometimes feels wrong because it reveals with more clarity the situation you are already in - single and no family. It's just a shameful, helpless feeling place. No one will care to unjinx you.<br>
<br>
Maybe it knows all these 2d outlines at planes from seeing body flattened on retina at all planes (again usefulness of cartoons and wild shots that give you perspectives less common).<br>
<br>
What if the waves (theta, etc) are the carrier, but much finer stuff embedded in amplitude modulation (?).<br>
<br>
The story makes it realistic like draws inertial forces felt on body you're supposed to inhabit. And have real time access to change direction of story. The body out there can't sense. This is all you got for sensing.<br>
<br>
This thcp kinda make me feel depressed.<br>
<br>
For humans, poverty is the predator. That, and the mafia. Also, social exclusion. These are somewhat antagonistic, so running from poverty may increase or decrease social exclusion predator. You can't have guaranteed safety from all. Unless you are at the very top and control narrative.<br>
<br>
Blink left and right eye and you can actually see two perceptions. Even once both eyes you see both with one predominating and sliding over halfway to other to merge them into one. This is done at top consciousness level as you experience it. Just closing eyes you see the ramp down of that visual perceptual world in like a quarter second.<br>
<br>
I would call "limbic" or hipp the "categorization system" or ID system.<br>
<br>
Squirrels (rodents) have much higher concentration of cb1 in cerebellar cortex molecular layer so when they get high they act drunk!<br>
<br>
Maybe DG either gets the ID of current or the appropriate likeness table skewer or skewer ID. Maybe the auto association of CA3 is what layers (ID only) to skewer together to give meaning, then CA1 provides info to complete short videos (link ID to actuality of thing).<br>
<br>
Perhaps "shunt to consciousness" means "show to pfc."<br>
<br>
If bg hands off between multiple frequencies, New freq must know phasic place and within bank for drawing.<br>
<br>
A prominent spike in EEG does seem related to a more pronounced ring. Like hey pay attention.<br>
<br>
Maybe your brain can piece the 3D together (confidently place on bank) once rings get fast enough. At slower speeds and suppression perhaps only parts along ring are drawn.<br>
<br>
It's like since relativity self stay put, walking is like growth out back. In any infinitesimal time slice, cursor is at some phase but entire circle gets kicked out with cursor point hence why it is like bubbles blower or seeming double helix.but because you move thru this it's like you are making the progress of walking.<br>
<br>
The ring basic region is often the part of SPW that needs painted in that moment. Like eyes closed, you don't have to paint body in the time frames where you're lost in some other thought.<br>
<br>
I think a sudden attitude change is fine if story needs that to grab inertia at far off spot.<br>
The truth can't be fucked jami<br>
<br>
Could visual skins (like from fast moving line rotation) be kind of because blindness caused during saccade? More exposed for that portion since have to blind during saccade movement.<br>

One stimulus on retina could come from different size, angle (depth), depth, motion speed, and motion direction <br>
100 rods (each detecting 1 photon) converging on one bipolar cell. Limit. Cones as sensitive as rods but different convergence.<br>
Left LGN sees only right visual field contribution from both eyes. Six layers, and each is an entire circle map with retinotopy. Stick pin down, neurons fire in response to same point on retinal map!!!!!<br>
Wow LGN prolly determines depth!!!!!!!!!!<br>
As you get higher beyond v1, you lose retinotopy as receptive field size increases (detection of larger shapes by decrease of specificity?). Mt, vP etc yea they have some neurons that respond to motion or whatever but a lot of neurons that don't (bank?)<br>
Knowledge is lost by spatial separation. You'd need to sense it again.<br>
<br>
Consciousness, at least the story part (leave out visual for a second?), isn't really about a frequency. It's more like, there has to be a CONTINUAL FEED with SUFFICIENT RESOLUTION. Yes, you need to include frequencies of sound onto it. There can be focal and visual curve-cuts at certain frequencies, <br>
Almost like visual is done by curve cut i.e. attitude changes. And cursor must be higher freq or this continuous thing.<br>

In dogs, feelings (emotional cartoons) implement motor no filter. In cats, feelings (emotional cartoons - does Midnight need wet food? Chicken?) have no connection to motor action <br>
<br>
Eyes closed an object depicted in flow spun CCW a couple times pretty fast then stopped spinning then faded out. Physical eyes towards computer but mind's eye thot physical eyes were  more towards ceiling.<br>
<br>
Falling asleep I mapped sound from Midnight clawing sheet to what I was imagining first.<br>
<br>
The stuff of twilight zone is almost so difficult to map in a meaningful way that you get very hallucinatory things and have no need for storing in memory until full fledged dream where senses cut off.<br>
<br>
Head toward piano I (in story) know midnight is over there behind me licking his claws even tho rings are painting over here. Consciousness is a STORY! Can spatial thus be patterns? Not in a directly spatial mapping, but paint by memory of pattern? And PFC has memory meanings?<br>
<br>
"Goose out of a region, goose out of a city " dream - should have been geese. Did I hear someone say that outside or do I lack syntax in dreams.<br>
<br>
Could flow be the sound asked to travel in story like in real world from cats claws to your ears?<br>
<br>
Cat food, queen sheets, blanket, pw, take glass <br>
When you move eyes to left it's like the canvas stays in place but you're looking more to left. Like the camera rotates about axis going thru itself.<br>
<br>
It's not about knowing. It's about painting a story that pfc can understand and act based on.<br>
<br>
Maybe it's like where to project from each ring is meaning provided. Could degree of confidence be encoded by level of opacity?<br>
<br>
Could there be a reader of consciousness data in the brain? Could cortex (spatial problem) or something in thalamus be this?<br>
<br>
Taps on window with drone the adaptation of midnight knocking pet door. Why don't you remember rest of dream? Cause they were all incorrect mappings and cortex is programmed to reject inaccuracies for survival's sake.<br>
<br>
I think sober, CMW is (proportionally to SPW) just "loud enough" to help pfc to extract meanings and help it move thru world and thru thought, without being so loud as to be noticeably visible and distracting. High, since ostensibly SPW gets somewhat inhibited, CMW now appears quite loud and therefore clearly visible, but also somewhat distracting and disorienting! Ostensibly, CMW is drawn by auditory and/or motor/PFC cortex. But also moderately high in PHZ.<br>
<br>
Coming into bright light after pet smart then closing eyes the "flat" visual field morphed like a water bed.<br>
<br>
What if inside corners and even wierder angle straight lines require cube to be rotated on sphere bank to get to?<br>
<br>
When you see the lines shorter in hallway, that isn't the 3d. That is a 2d at your location rep of light ray traces so and so image from outer concentric shells via geometry. This is a geometry issue why lines are smaller, not a "viewer" issue. The geometry "places" where the look or "viewer" must be to logically obtain that result from a 3d ray trace. You have some position and vector of "you view camera" for any  2D rendering of 3D! It's built into it. When movies can be closer to 3D and swivel your chair, you get even more sense of "viewer" and therefore that film is "real."<br>
<br>
So it appears brain is somewhere somehow making a 3D model and then shooting ray traces of it with rotating (rather, swinging) cameras. Or is it rotating the 3D model? Cinematography, called "arc shot" or "360Â° tracking shot." Such a shot could be obtained by spinning the whole scene the opposite direction.<br>
<br>
Is the insula the ring factory and broken glass (unlikely - doesn't join)? And DMN swings the camera (or scene) of CMW, while CEN/FEF handles camera of SPW?<br>
<br>
Right anterior insula may be rings for Salience Network/DMN(CMW), and other insula the rings for CEN(SPW). Then, medial pfc is for CMW when it models SPW. <br>
<br>
Or, could CEN be CMW when it is drawing SPW, and DMW be when CMW is drawing cartoons? Then medial pfc would be for keeping cartoons useful to what is seen in SPW.<br>
<br>
There's no such thing geometrically as seeing in 3D. Seeing is a 2D object obtained from a ray trace of some point and direction and some 3D scene. You ascribe distances to provide 3D understanding and "convert" the points to a morphed 3D scene, but it is morphed, with farther items scrunched and closer items stretched.<br>
<br>
A morphed 3D skin scene also has a viewer location and direction baked in. By showing the relations and scrunchedness, you create a viewer.<br>
<br>
A square outline is such on a plane before hitting retina, but then corners hit first, and center most of lines hit last, bulged. How does base of square pyramid shell hit concavity.<br>
<br>
The car lines appear tilted up even tho not. Also to medial <br>
<br>
What if every line (inside corners of walls, etc) gets its own bank, but with only that line illuminated? Then a scene can be an aghlomeration of bank-to-bank relations. Like stretch(transform) the whole matrix.<br>
