<h1>Raw Journals: Trip 8</h1>

<p>The following are notes from 8/17/22 (6-second inhale of legal strawberry cheesecake hhc hemp vape) and extra filler added later in contemplation. The reason there are typos is because I swiped it all out with my finger on my iPhone as quickly as I could and didn't want to lose thoughts by going back when iPhone keyboard was being stupid. Some of the things I can no longer tell exactly what word I was going for, so I'm leaving the text alone. I think the most philosophical thought can be gotten from it that way. I add filler here and there to help provide context/meaning. These notes should be taken in a philosophical way - I write everything down that comes to mind without checking it; then I can check and consider the things later. Thus, statements that appear as fact may be me looking at something a certain way and trying it on, but it doesn't mean that I fully agree with it. These notes are more like grasping to try to understand consciousness and just things in general.<br>

Yo 8/29/22 lucid blue gonna stealth inside this 8/17 note mother f*cker.<br>
<br>
Puzzle pieces looking retina line to something ticked away Spirograph ball down to feet and to right direction. The puzzle pieces are the left bank prints of Spirograph bank. Like of sight was broken fracture ie puzzle edge.<br>
<br>
Might push skewer (left to right) from inside out like filter by memory of smell armpit. Then peeled off spirograph way <br>
<br>
High, every show you can see they are actors. Sober you are fooled into thinking real life is being portrayed.<br>
<br>
Mom kitchen doors is another one.<br>
<br>
Use go to sleep lullaby to seduce you (trigger kid memories and convince you it is real life)<br>
<br>
Dream. Light chocolate girl. I'm looking at her and she's starting to turn had so I don't look too much but I think she kind of likes the attention.<br>
<br>
<br>
Would be nice to add cartoon showing frames of consciousness peeling off at different evolution phases. <br>
<br>
<br>
Skins are painted but they paint the cartoon from that other view of puzzle pieces <br>
Attentional popo car split in half by ring disintegrating to 3d puzzle pieces.<br>
Bank is metal frame bubble blower that "rings" (whole colored puzzles) come off of.<br>
Bubbles out of both sides of blower <br>
Inertia of the story so if you're body then move to your body, if in front, then in front like car dash. This ring is in story IN STORY has to move properly in story. IT is that that is being drawn. And yes, time and intensity can draw this vibrations on this surface over time. Over time is story in time. Can easily be drawn by single ring (point over time). <br>
<br>
Filler: I think you're saying that it's like a photo except reduced to a line which, over real time the line can be seen to be a helix of painting. So that radial distance out to object is given by understood meaning. And it may be firing 3D skins at same time so that you can easily get meaning.<br>
<br>
Filler: I try harder now than as a kid but now they all hate me, so it means they are messed up not me; but I don't want to say they are messed up cause they are the ones that did me good and their past is the only good I know in the world!<br>
<br>
Filler: High: frame (making ring), pause, cog; sober: frame&cog simultaneous (making helix). Perhaps ring and pause happen during silence (dendritic oscillations); spike train is cog. Unless ring is spike train and pause is cause hose pinched and cog is integration (dendritic oscillations).<br>
<br>
It is time and required story meaning (3d drawing) required over time. Yea mostly stay with car but don't have to. Could go over to trees. It's all (radius, vibration) by meaning for that vibration to make sense.<br>
A bubble blower held as stationary mostly.<br>
So, chronogenesis. <br>
Story colorized is that which can create meaning of temporal sequence of firing.<br>
And maybe that net thing conscious from unconscious.<br>
Maybe hexagon consciousify temporal electrical activity. Should be able to measure direct complex eeg over time and the complex signal plotted in software that corkscrews it out at 3d spatial points at varying rates and concavities/convexities/normal and a story arise between rings over time plus story over time.<br>
Ring coronal from dick to toilet- your piss still able to be drawn because story moved and rings moved <br>
The whole 3D chunk (puzzle piece) is getting drawn and comes out of ring inside-area perpendicular out.<br>
Color has to be drawn by this ever present ring or bubble blower. Any freq can come off it or through it.<br>
In story, Brad can be painted looking thru ring at phone and view axis is nearly perpendicular to ring plane. They also have to look thru this straw. Other times "CMW" can look at thing from side. Of course random ring in SPW can be an arbitrary slice thru CMW no problem.<br>
Throw might better be called story-induced infliction on the ring. Story is believable that's why you see and feel it.<br>
Rings is the point to affect change in story. It prints story (which is painted/colored in the printing). Ring is central painter of consciousness, prolly made by vibrations over time. Color comes from this. A point within ring could draw for looking over letter basketball.<br>
Yea bank is print head. Prolly points and their lagging or advancing the 3d print head. By being the right amount forward or back, they can print meaning of a stable printhead. Ink leaks from all spots a tiny bit to reveal bank. Time lag plus meaning adhesion at back of tenderizer or front of tenderizer bank bubble blower. All of the brain is painting story in color.<br>
Look, body world or SPW can be drawn as needed in story. Different angle of view of ring can reveal two worlds traced. Two worlds can come together at times.<br>
It really is the interdigitated (by shifted meaning view axis as required) temporal firing plotted with allowed story time <br>
The two give up one spatial to time. <br>
It's drawing a world that flows with the time you give it, but in a different way than the flow of SPW.<br>
So not really interdigitated, just smart so that one thing from two ways draws two worlds with meaning of flow of each.<br>
Whatever you notice, that throw is drawn - do gravity for 1/10th second, frames down; back leaned on counter focus for 2/10th seconds, frames meeting there.<br>
Now sagittal shaft can draw attention to weight of (of fkoor against) feet, to head, to butt against counter as printing out with time to the two sides.<br>
Like whatever component has to bear on it therefore can paint almost flat. Half of ring may get a chance to "see" it radially inward on ring and paint it. Painting flat not a problem either, so much story or ring movement (or both).<br>
It's what the cursor sees radially inward at each phasic moment. The arcing is within story!<br>
Flow is by degree of distance (within story) change in meaning being painted over time.<br>
Flow is going 20mph out my back and down but I think puzzle pieces being drawn out both sides slowly. Flow seems to do color and rings originatorFatherBlower does shapes which paint even the color of story which often includes SPW.<br>
Only the sounds needful to story's character's attention need be drawn. If whole song in attention then you got it! But can be drawn as background.<br>
Hysteresis of ring just makes it more cinematic like slow careful walking camera video man.<br>
When it came out. So, inertial movement vibrated when that in ring then flow is kicking Brad current ring back into past to that spatial distance.<br>
A whole 1-second chunk of puzzle pieces is created from ring outwards <br>
Certain things vibrated now are intended for real future "looks past"<br>
Rock a (coronal) ring CW (view from above) to change something before leaving in the direction of the real future but looking past on right back of body. Or, CCW to predict or draw of real furuter comport because what's drawn has a full second of travel.<br>
Yes story's time is one of the axes assumed by brain in what 3D world is getting drawn by ring.<br>
There really is no frequency. There's a speed at which puzzle pieces getting drawn outwards the meaning dictates or reveals the speed. <br>
This is the unfolding of the basketballs. A bubble blower with growing radius cylinder squats coming out. <br>
You know if you got frames maybe it did first draw the ring then the story offset happened abruptly.<br>
So yea there prolly is ring offset and then flow or cog offset (when consciousness smooth, like helix). And maybe even blow offset in addition!<br>
Look, it doesn't have to be a helix - it can be any wonky corkscrew traceout whatever (tracer can hold still for a moment to make a line perp to ring). You as studyer looking at waves(neural firings) need to spatially offset (with according amount of time distance in video software) paster moments in the movie you are trying to figure out how to see sober thru telescope. <br>
<br>
Filler: it's like two flows are coming out of same consciousness-seeding ring (/tracer)- SPW and CMW, as two firework snake-worms in separate directions. But both come out both sides of blower. And there is a blow too which can put drawn vibrations to where needed when kinda outside scope of flow and rings. By changing meaning in what is drawn can make it look like flow happened cause it's what would be required to make the drawing of old and new meet up properly. You use actual time passage to "kick out" paster stuff relative to newer stuff in drawing meaning as this changing (ie 3d rotating) axial dimension. I think there's nothing neurospatial. The spatial is done inside the calculations. Perceptuospatial done by the actual time dimension given to changing (3d rotating) axial dimension (flow out drawn over time), and smaller changes within actual time given to axial x/y and a unit of time dedicated to one circle. Something "holds on" to stuff for that one second window also, dunno what. It's like you should get high, record yourself on camera, and headbang at each cycle begin of ring and hand showing plane and other hand showing growing out of flow in one direction. And something to align brain signals (need to wear charged eeg band) such as show on camera and be movie recording the screen of iPhone too.<br>
<br>
Filler: do double bonds vibrating put fine vibrations on Ca2+(?) or Na+ incoming? HHC has no double bonds in closest ring but further ring still has three double bonds that can vibrate in two locations. Or do the vibrations on these rings serve as carrier wave of consciousness with passing Na+ in pulses being the info signal that is carried? Do they align to a single plane (either the ones attached or some attached resonant with free in cerebrospinal fluid or just the cerebrospinal fluid)? And this plane 3d rotates?<br>
<br>
Filler: It says all it needs is that tracer moving over time, but really it needs to paint meaning, depth, color, a whole plane, hold on to stuff for one second. Perhaps holding on is that tuning up the Q circuit and most tuned is current and most focused and as it decoheres it fades and time plus current drawing shows it must be moved out spatially. If so, even the not fully tightened freqs in circuit matter and are painting less focal bits of consciousness. Maybe it is still pulling off a jennifer Aniston bank. Maybe bank is bigger than you think but less leaky on larger shells.<br>
<br>
Filler: there could be a little phasic progression and leaky all at once simultaneously. And leaky of whole plane to draw that.<br>
<br>
Filler: the most impactful giving I can do is none by just using everything I have "for myself for study tools" by focusing on my passions that could end up giving things way better than the money in someone else's hands. Like tesla or any inventor. Stated another way, I give via what I purchase. In other words, NO HANDOUTS from me directly may result in bigger ultimate handouts of tech improvement. And if I had been guilt tripped into fiat giving away, I might not have been able to deliver the way better thing to the way more people and in a way that overthrows the mafia and requires people to be good. Also, by refusing to fiat give to these people, I judge the righteous judgment that I am better than they which I am because they are out of control, do nothing (in comparison), lack morals, and need confrontation. Stated another way, I am a very caring person that would love to give, but don't have much, and used to give when I could, but have been as a whole very poorly treated by church sneaksters and more or less robbed of my life. I have to take care of myself before I will be able to take care of anyone else.<br>
<br>
In one second it may have moved around in attitude and phase.<br>
You have to guess, by retrying the same saved progression of firing, what the intended helix over time was. And you have to go thru the gate keepers encryption of what story's intended inertial bits are. So it would help to have a high subject who clearly sees what story and activity at hand in real world actually are for that duration cause that's what to look for.<br>
The swath of frequencies at each instantaneous point is the cursor of ring at each phasic point.<br>
All it has to do is draw the person shouting and pain on face and a tiny bit of vibration to give complete felt meaning of the pain because empathy.<br>
I think your ring evolution is wrong. Scrap it.<br>
During the time duration of flow there can be shown the spatial movement of last axis in story <br>
If you grow out my left side past ward (coronal ring) faster, you MOVE (3d rotate) the ring's left side forward within physical world (nearing sagittal).<br>
I think cortico thalamo cortico 40Hz narrow and then widen Q, could be the circuit of consciousness. And timing at each stage of window the firing must be exactly right. The carrying on helps it stay online.<br>
Now you know why bank needs so many spheres - cause rings!! And what deviations from ring paint the story world. Squares provide flat edges. And within this die you can look inwards to see meaning of letter without that realm mucking up as yet another realm. Cause it's within the die!!<br>
Yes fake gravity water does shift attitude of this ring!<br>
Bank can prolly roll it's attitude tho not seen here.<br>
The attitude of the ring (or bubble blower) is so central, but it is within story, so just need to do calculations to include it, nothing perceptuospatial. <br>
Yes I think cerebellum is for accuracy in layout of SPW and CMW (and?) in determining slice's location in 3D layout. You carve it out against rest even if by negative relief.<br>
You <br>
Multiple freq rings can draw out (?)<br>
I draw that it is inflating over time.<br>
It's like 3d rotation of ring is known and planned against with time so that you can Bing impact at the right spot with given flow <br>
<br>
3D ring rotation (plus did you draw 1' or 2' of air by now between his arm?) = flow.<br>
How can it do viewer? Cause it's in the story.<br>
How can it vibrate for further away from ring inertia (?) because a certain amount of flow spatial distance WAIT time was meant. Vibration happens, then WAIT the exact time, and it falls beautifully into place. Body coronal ring (I'm lying on bed) head crown side of ring raised. You the viewer have to do a bit of prediction of cat bite if it lies at a point in space forward or backward of the ring (the incoming flow). I bet this way it can be present even when saying it's a little in past!<br>
Frames laid down like sheets like in book but in giant sagittal (to chest to ceiling) doughnut looking turn of corkscrew. Lay rate and then white view rate could lag a little to bring more attention.<br>
It can rock the ring to fix a needed correction by adding wait time (going into the future to fix a paster thing)<br>
Drawing wise there are only two axes within story dedicated to space. The story that arises obviously has its third spatial dimension, but to paint it, in any given moment, only 2D. Over time, the changes in what this ring is drawing imply rotation of reading ring from that perspective and/or rotation of story world. So you really do need to know depth of dua face at that angle from viewer of 2D slice the radial distance at each point so paint her 3D skin over time.<br>
Maybe any or lots of stories (lives/people) can be read from the vibration of universe one existence rope vibrate.<br>
Ring paracoronal midnight leg against my right arm inner surface that surface perpendicular to rings so duration of waitness from 0.1 to 0.4 seconds neurons firing to show pressure of whole surface.<br>
The spirograph can be doughnut rings getting laid down in sagittal giant screw I think. It's how painted conscious existence is laid down.<br>
Coronal( body) rings can reach left side upwards in direction of fan noise and over three frames reach it, to draw attention to the where of that noise (but still fan is painted in story at right spot). Maybe this is a connection with "sensory physical world." But I thot it was there already man.<br>
Like two eyeballs going around the bank one SPW viewer angle of ring and the other CMW viewer angle of ring, and sometimes CMW aligns with SPW view angle and meaning traced by ring.<br>
But yes bank is sphere you view with dish retina. Yea I think CMW view angle could be smaller and hence the smaller graphic generally too.<br>
Because the view angle can split off, you can use just component of ring vibrating one (perpendiculars-to-that-view) way to show one world and another another.<br>
What solid what seen from that mental eye dudes perspective.<br>
It's like you need to train a computer to recognize when it is tracing a 3D moving scene of people etc by corkscrew attitude and thread pitch and etc assumed correctly finally.<br>
Maybe you can have patterngenesis (but not perceptuo yet) which then does crazy good math for ring inhibition (cerebellar return signal) to make extra sense. In this way, cerebellum could make consciousness more accurate.<br>
The reason you see (note) rings high is cause the ring isn't drawing as prefectly as usual (sober). SPW/CMW aren't evolution but the product of the rings (and flow over time).<br>
40 Hz draws SPW 2d + flow; 2-10 Hz draws CMW 2d + flow.<br>
<br>
8/18/22 2 sec puff<br>
<br>
Of course you can move van halen cartoon around by moving phone speaker around- sound has to seem like it's coming from origin location of sound in SPW.<br>
You really are flying thru time meter thing maybe that blows stuff off?<br>
Flow off story may be blow it is fast small diameter yellow coming off small story steely Dan eyes closed blow off SPW translucent large diameter slow. CMW Like parachute with pink coming out.<br>
<br>
Is this (my life) a porn film for aliens since it shows my honest thoughts? And wonk?<br>
<br>
Sleep with you in the desert with a billion stars all around - painted a sphere (I'm lying down) above right shoulder 1' to center of this scene looking footwards it's up also my AGU but not hcu.<br>
<br>
My story is infinite - infinite repped as hourglass shape conic section grey outline with tapered out to transparent skins (birdhouse in your soul)<br>
Sagittal pinwheel from belly button to doorwall paddles going down below back holding fixed point behind head coming round fast that flow. Blower bubble from mid above head to belly button.<br>
Creep bb from right ear over 2' it's printing (body horizontal) sheets malleable and frame rate of these sheets is song vibrations needed flowing to door.<br>
The flow grows in size like bubbles. Seems to happen naturally. Blow direction is there blowing directionally too.<br>
Creep left ear ring left ear over left (body horizontal), sphere incoming from behind /hcu, spirograph into ring and print out be printed on rather by bank and suck back out and other way fast - 40 Hz? Or even Hz of song, but printing. Continual flow of spheres coming in getting printed rolling out maybe hundreds over a second or two.<br>
Prayer to good at right ball roll over to left ear to pay attention to that cartoon but roll is in physical world see.<br>
Sudan close door ring from back down to first story blow is drivewayward.<br>
Collective soul shine left ear can paint me thinking of acro or cartoon of shine ring above heart and ceilingdoorwall side lifted flow is out towards acro scene which is above right elbow so can move in frames to get from acro to cartoon. So "time" movement of focus of which ring "current" possible. All this is drawn in story is a part of story don't trip its nothing hard brain wise. You just gotta figure out how it's making this story in the first place.<br>
It may be flow curves and comes back around like a recyclerView.<br>
Black hole sun gap after no one's sings like you anymore focus follows last sound over rightwards as it fades.<br>
You could look at it as bank stays stationary with you as you go up stairs and whole of SPW is getting kicked down. It's just which reference frame.<br>
Flow going out of my head towards left of ceiling fan.<br>
It doesn't have to be (and can't be) perfectly perpendicular flow to surface or ring.<br>
Filler: but all of this second day (2s puff) is kinda guess work since none of it is overpoweringly clear.<br>
Filler: maybe it's like the brain needs the PSG for its bank and for creating the 3D-rotating helix through time, but the means of perceptuospatiogenesis is the chrono theory and rotations of meaning help 3D to pop.<br>
Filler: I think the hippocampus is the skewerer. Could cerebellum be drawing the ring at any evolution via negative relief (so actually in cerebral cortex at finish)? Maybe the brain can make do without cerebellum (with help from thalamus and PPN?) but draws ring much less accurately. Or is it more like the ring draws the story of consciousness and that's all there is is ring?<br>
You experience the decisions it makes<br>
Close your eyes SPW is built out of nothing but random disjointed memory frames at 40 Hz. It can hollow out a negative relief sphere that moves to show inertia of body. Could each sheet (eyes open) draw first spatial location of future then a video of changing what is drawn moment by moment as it advances thru to past spatial position?<br>
Muscimol is a full gabaA and partial gabaC agonist <br>
Pg 107 add opium next to heroin. Add muscimol (of fly agaric) in barbiturate.<br>
Opioid actually inhibits gaba release a little, weird. Cause I thot gaba agonism could be cause of dreamy feel.<br>
Itch satisfaction ("can't get no satisfaction") comes from the surface that itches sensing scratching, not from the fingers doing the scratching (chin example).<br>
Consciousness feels like something because it is a perturbation. A continuous series of perturbations that bring new things to focus.<br>
The frame becomes more and more past and gets kicked out. I don't think content changes unless current rings swing back to update it. It looks like it gets swung in a direction as kicked out because of relativity - rings are painting things in a shifted swing in physical space of modeled world, but rings seem mostly stationary (reference frame), so past appears swung.<br>
So the spirographic ball print thing- two uses of bank (well maybe the stator can get one use over all) for each frame of printed consciousness - this frame moves out on ball. So several banks piggyback bank for the frames, plus intersection with printhead bank and water level prints current frame.<br>
Here's a thot - cerebral does 3D+1T skins; cerebellum loop enables cerebral 2D+2T which enables good planning, error correction, and spatial acuity. A bank devoted to skins and a bank devoted to rings. Hippocampus/amygdala loop helps give MEANING or FAMILIARITY via skewers and occasional memory frames. Thalamic loop builds up to 3D skins and allows connections to other things. Basal ganglia loop is speed and direction of physical or mental movement (including moral and efficiency filters?). At night ARAS loop hyperpolarizes thalamus to shut down cortex from real world mapping.<br>
New bank: 0D+4T gives you cursor of chronospatiogenesis; 1D+3T reveals ring; 2D+2T reveals sheets.<br>
New bank: 3D+1T gives patternspatiogenesis and reveals 3D; could 4D give coloration?<br>
Aphanitic - not visible (Greek)<br>
Phaneritic - visible (Greek)<br>
Does cerebrum go thru cerebellar loop prior to hippo loop? If so, maybe it goes ahead and finds the 2D plane, then passes to hipp to draw rings.<br>
I think (order wise; collaterals can go first to hipp) sensory must pass thru PHZ to PFC, CMW must integrate with SPW, get info from cerebellum on helix, get speed from basal ganglia, and draw rings and flow via hipp.<br>
Could it be hippocampus is an actual neurospatial bank, with movements of head not really mattering because it is more the relational spatial set up? Because you don't feel movement, but you do feel (apparently) electricity.<br>
If hipp is seat of consciousness, the incoming 40 Hz is SPW colored skins, 7-14 Hz is rings/flow, 3 Hz is slower helix rings, 20 Hz is maybe CMW translucent skins.<br>
Pg 40 DG, ca3, ca1 seem to have text boxes.<br>
Could flow be that reverberations of CSG don't die out completely until 0.5 seconds?<br>
Could hipp (or ento) be 3D fire together wire together for making 3D skins? Then it could also do 3D likeness comparisons. <br>
It isn't broadcasting to dna to make consciousness cause you can lose a hand and immediately there is no diminution in total consciousness plus after long time it can still say hand is there.<br>
Maybe freq of em waves can make consciousness.<br>
Quantum collapse does not give rise to consciousness for eye is not conscious (or at least not connected to body response to say so).<br>
<br>
Filler Aug 26: dreamed of pissing twice- long time against glass window/door in restaurant ppl nearby were a little disturbed, grandma was there, I literally didn't think it was wrong altho I knew they might get a little disturbed sillily. Another piss at geology school and it was a urinal with stainless steel and a little hole but if you aimed at hole you got spray. I got spray whatever I did but minimized by going to side a bit. Another teacher had a loft that I went up into but it as hard and little guy was helping me set up the rig to make climbing up easier.<br>
<br>
Filler: it's like when you dream you don't just mind wander well maybe it's similar - but it's imagined as real life episodes that are getting added to your memory. It's as tho <br>
<br>
Filler: generally, during superficial day dreaming, one little thot is broken up and goes to a totally new direction. With dreams, you get some breaks, but you get long durations of a single unified story new episode.<br>
<br>
Filler: played game of soccer on rock waterfall thing. He had upslope advantage. Ryan Jarrett or a mix of the three. Before next round I wanted to prep - get better shoes, etc etc etc.<br>
<br>
Filler: could expand chapter 6-<br>
Summary trips 1-7; summary trips 8-14; summary table; summary of timeline of thinking; summary of helpful input from other people; summary of effects of cannabinoid and other neurotransmitters; raw journal trips 1-7; raw journal trips 8-14.<br>
<br>
Filler: could greatly improve micro and macro chapters. <br>

How exactly does it do 2/2? Is inhibition inward radial distance and excitation is outward radial distance?<br>
<br>
How does it do 3/1? Like toe wiggle of CMW?<br>
<br>
Try high - look close up like at book or phone and ensure rings are small, then look over and see how the color is placed of far off stuff. Does ring suddenly grow?<br>
<br>
SPW shuts off during REM. During REM, story is painted with "real world" skins of PHZ! But not just any kind of story - a story with long episodes maybe 20 minutes long compared to the usual 0.25 seconds-long episodes.<br>
<br>
Could it be colorness is a what - a very fast mapping to memories and a familiarity? Or is it something as different as skewers are from vibes? Does it use the bank somehow?<br>
<br>
Makes it look like time is carrying it to location even tho it must be shown spatially to move.<br>
<br>
Cerebellum could be storage of spatial info of bank (and rings, skins), and inhibitory signals it sends or doesn't send draws bank/rings/skins/bb on cortex.<br>

What differentiates feeling of seeing vs that which is seen? Does the seen exert force on the seeing? And the seeing moves itself? Like the column thing? Each column moves its sensor as desired. But eye column must work with every other column of eye. It's integrated into one task at a time for eye. So like superior colliculi move eyes, and what, frontal eye field?<br>
<br>
Like the seen is data coming in to top level viewer (frontal eye fields?)?<br>
<br>
If fish are not conscious, there's not a lot of behavioral difference between conscious and automata.<br>

Maybe it joins the eyes by shifting left and right the proper amount so they agree. Separate, left eye says my finger(no, wall) is 2 spots to right; right eye says finger is 2 spots to left; open both eyes, and left eye moves view two spots to the left, and right eye moves view two spots to the right, so now the two views merge. But only for far away stuff. Closer stuff, stays more fixed if focused on finger. Focal plane. If focused on finger both eyes open, two sets of walls in background. If focused on walls in background, two sets of fingers. Focus on toe there are two fingers and two walls, though not as displaced.<br>
<br>
This is amazing. When you shift from left eye to right eye to left eye, it does not feel like you are shifting viewing location 2.5 inches, even tho you are. Hence you can propriocept finger eyes closed at nose, but left eye finger is very right; right eye finger is very left!!!!<br>
Proximal focus, right eye sees righter finger copies; distal focus, right eye sees lefter finger copies; but, fingers are always left of visible copy of fan.<br>
<br>
Proximal focus, homo (left eye's distal double shifts left); distal focus, hetero (left eye's proximal double shifts right); middle ways focus, proximal shifts right, distal shifts left. Reverse for other eye.<br>
<br>
Like star wars girl saying "usually, when you say, do I even feel anything different?" is when you realize "woah, something might be weird." (About getting high on weed or lsd or something). That which most people only notice as "something weird" is what I also once only noticed as "what the heck is that?!" until I payed very careful attention and saw it was rings/bank drawing consciousness! Passing from smooth to cyclic consciousness.<br>

Dream: had a vacation with family, it was almost back to good ole times. John uncle wrestled with me, Dad wrestled. In RV at end prepping to leave, could look off see ocean and people along road. People were happy (really, ie the kind that makes you friendly) like olden time.<br>

Ontogeny refers to the development of an organism while phylogeny refers to how the organisms have evolved.<br>

Layer III - skewers via extensive corticocortical connections? (Joaquin Fuster The Prefrontal Cortex, Pg. 17) - continue neuronal differentiation into puberty via cholinergic innervation into the layer. More superficial layers grow last (II, III); deeper develop first (IV, V, VI).<br>
