<h1>Raw Journals: Trip 2</h1>

<p>The following are notes from 1/20/22 (taking two legal hemp gummies) and extra filler added later in contemplation. The reason there are typos is because I swiped it all out with my finger on my iPhone as quickly as I could and didn't want to lose thoughts by going back when iPhone keyboard was being stupid. Some of the things I can no longer tell exactly what word I was going for, so I'm leaving the text alone. I think the most philosophical thought can be gotten from it that way. I add filler here and there to help provide context/meaning. These notes should be taken in a philosophical way - I write everything down that comes to mind without checking it; then I can check and consider the things later. Thus, statements that appear as fact may be me looking at something a certain way and trying it on, but it doesn't mean that I fully agree with it. These notes are more like grasping to try to understand consciousness and just things in general.<br>

Notes :<br>
<br>
<br>FILLER: When you see me talking about "filter by," I'm referring to a unique experience when high where I find myself "panning through" memories I wouldn't otherwise be able to, via by some filtering commonality such as same exact shade of color, etc. Each memory may get 1/100th of a second or less, but as you pan through them, the common aspect comes to the fore.<br>
2:00 already setting in with an Indica feel.<br>
Filter by BBQ TASTE. Small smell component but you remember it as you experience it so  smells that seem like tastes get registered as tastes.<br>
<br>
Filter memory by Dad opens kitchen door.<br>

There's so much I didn't write down. The cube can be an ice cube floating in dirty glacial water. It's bobbing moves the ring of fire around to intersection of water. Like onion skin layer after layer of surface of ring of focus. Mihht be better to call them ring of focus.<br>
<br>
Important the ring is the ring of focus. So proportion of total sphere used on Vc is moot. It could be 100% in some cases, 0% in a lot of cases like when eyes closed.<br>
<br>
Heartbeat shows up as throb on rings as they move through time. But only when you're paying attention to your heart beat.<br>
<br>
It's the movement though threeD ring patterns - the tunneling!!!!! - creates sense of external force in arm. Creates sense of everything.<br>
<br>
Main thing - there's this 3d squiggly ring of the things you decided to focus on and the movement from that ring to the next (the changings upon the ring inwards or outwards or whatever gave rise to jerk in knee which jerked over to get in the ring as it raced by- creates all sense of preception. Perception is the things that feel like forces moving the squiggly of you from one 3D trace to the next. Color and all is certain inertial movements by parts of ring it's like a game - trace movement using this changing squiggly and rotate the frame and scale as needed. So color and all is the inertial pressures of the 4th D time. Like Russians said - all senses is touch fundamentally, which is time moving (or geometry) fundamentally. It's like you are tracing out a 3D+T. Perception is the rate at which time is made to pass. Time is an axis with locations. Movement through time axis gives rise to perception. It really feels like rings whether fast short onion ring ones or longer-gapped ones ). It feels like me moving my leg but puzzle-piece wise it's just the changing frames(pieces). Visual field like phone seemed flat and perpendicular to rings somewhat. Visual field may also be laid out by faster tesla beam going mostly in rings (left right spin, etc.) from thalamus to cortex. Focus has to "change its focal depth" from 10Hz to 40Hz- you can only focus on one at a time I think.<br>
<br>
The Rings are changing shape and place but the focus on world they are modeling that world is getting sucked thru rings and man handled like the Styrofoam ball by spider and even scaled up or down at an even faster and more changeable rate and further distance from ring tags to ring tags (tagged intersections of its 3d with your focus ring). Change on rings of fire gives rise to inertial changes in muscles/Body. Changes in tagged ring within percept world being small or large or oriented certain ways or vibrating at certain rates may be the defining mechanism that gives rise to color and others. Altho it could also be a gamma wave thing.<br>
<br>
It's almost as tho with vision you get a scanning across 2d plane focal SURFACE (rather than just a 3d ring LINE) but allowed to be oriented in 3ds and curved and as that stays mostly the same it provides the bedrock for referencing us. I would suspect waves of a vertical line going left to right or really vice versa so left to right in visual field - across v2 or v4 or v5 or both of the last. Is color the frequency of inclusion of a point into the focal ring? The temporal frequency of inclusion into focus?<br>
<br>
The multiskin onion rings of focus this time were very similar in size as they aged unlike last time where they shrank considerably to one past and one future ring.<br>
<br>
The jerkiness high could be cerebellum lagging pfc/thalamic alpha waves.<br>
<br>
Or maybe cerebellum has rings of fire (alpha) while cerebrum has gamma and visual audio world which is representation of the world which is being man handled like the Styrofoam ball. Or better yet go backwards - the cerebrum (mainly hot zone) is providing ring of focal fire shape and the cerebellum is providing how much movement happens and what direction at each point on ring to prep to next ring of fire shape. By cerebellum telling vectors at each location, it thereby describes the slice of the physical world it is trying to model ie which way is up for that world and what the object one edges are etc.<br>
<br>
The cerebellum provides the spider-handling-styrofoam-ball saccades that together with the cerebrum define focus ring as it lights upon that world.<br>
<br>
Maybe having a cerebellum adds to fluidity of perception.<br>
<br>
The ring is the things you are focused on. The angle and distance on each point on ring needs to be specified in 3D by brain, but not necessarily by a geometrically identical neural layout in physical universe. It would need phase (=time) (0-360°, but doesn't have to start at zero), declenation (-90-90°), and radial distance out.<br>
<br>
Since we moved we're in a sphere of big bang initial radiation that is smaller. Therefore background radiation has shifted??<br>
<br>
Since we're moving a little thru space therefore we pass through time slightly more slowly than  (but still very close to same speed as) light? A compression of charge (inertial acceleration) results in white (black??) and a rarefaction in black (white?)?<br>
<br>
As you learn more about brain waves, you may be able to devise a method for discerning at least hz of waves and marine basic outline while sober- say eyes closed on bed imagining ring hula hoop or even one that lights up or a real one you hold and parts of it vibrate and you imagine and focus on your heartbeat, hoop, and some muscle movement at same time.<br>
<br>
It's like thc increases the shutter exposure (but not the cycle rate which stays variable or even slows down) (nor the rate of time) or your movie existence. Longer freeze frames means movie gets choppier as edges become more discontinuous and there's less time proportionally than usual per cycle devoted to transition. You gain a little more time to look at each frame and hence can make better decisions especially socially.<br>
<br>
I think rings of fire really may be dendritic. Why are some dendrites included and others not? Well included or not in ring but still why don't you feel any other neurons?<br>
<br>
If consciousness is created solely in the cerebellum, then someone who never had a cerebellum it would be hard to see their lack of consciousness. Body/brain is still going to behave as always (though jerkier). Someone who lost part of their cerebellum tho in life would know what it had felt like to have a smooth consciousness, and would appear to take a definite loss!<br>
<br>
I think why depression can be long lasting is that for years you are encoding that outlook and mood into the loops for everyday objects and then hence a vacation to an unusual place with a person with good will and connection can really help such.<br>
<br>
Focus = cognizance. If you are focused on something you are cognizant of it. If you're cognizant of something you have at some point focused on it. Even if you have your fovea centered on a dot in a picture and there are color splotches around it here and there and the person asks you to keep your fovea locked on the dot you are able to tell what any of those colors are because your brain saccades over there and focuses the ring of fire to include that splotch somewhere along the temporal line. And so even though you were not cognizant of all the splotches in your view you can become cognizant in 1/40th of a second or less by bringing your ring of focus to alight on it.<br>
<br>
Q's while high -<br>
If you open eyes and focus on both yourself plus some object way far away like the moon - does ring grow really big or does universe scale down to fit in that? I think it's more like part of ring is devoted to moon and part is devoted to self and the physical ring needn't scale. It's almost like it's known that the part of the ring modeling the leg you know the scale and then you know that scale is CHANGING along the ring to enable it to reach and grab moon.<br>
<br>
you need synchrony say 10 hz to know which frame you’re talking about. Focal frame rate however is variable - remember that<br>
<br>
On hemp high you're like a computer that has gotten bogged down and you don't want to overload with data cause it's only able to change focus 3-10 rings a second (20-60 focal items per second).<br>
<br>
At any given moment, there is only one frequency for your brain waves of rings of fire focus. Yes it is variable, but at any given time, it's only one frequency. IMPORTANT!<br>
<br>
<br>
As you don't usually notice your eye saccades but rather a seeming whole, so you don't usually notice the brain saccading from ring of focus to ring of focus. You don't usually even notice an individual ring because you pass quickly through time and that smoothes it out into a seeming 41,253 square degree whole.<br>
<br>
All that's needed for perception is 4D geometry. So is brain even needed?<br>
<br>
It's the 3d imprint of time on your big ice cube peach broken glass as it bobs in the water. This ice cube is bank and it's intersection with water level you use to make shape of ring of fire, but turn reality thru this thing turn it/scale it however you must so that next intersection are the things you next want to focus on. The bobbing is your brain waves going back and forth over the territory that you have to work with. Maybe (the reason I can't say in real time here is because this Q didn't come to me till now and now the ice cube thing with water flowing in glass isn't going on strongly) the in flow and out flow of water in glass is timed with breath in breath out. Breath in, delta often rises, slow delta = ebb and flow of water surface going in and out of broke glass . 3d imprint is alpha or theta. Gamma almost feels like a second brain. The default mode network if delta may be the ebb and flow of water. You can focus on any 3d focal aspect of the ice cube as it bobs.<br>
<br>
You can and do go faster and slower through the onion skins, but not faster and slower through actually time.<br>
<br>
Could color be an acceleration of a spot on the ring? It may take 10-30 frames to see the acceleration.<br>
Notice a single frame wasn't about inertia change in this case but rather a single spasm in of leg covered 20 frames.<br>
Notice also frame rate must have been at least 20Hz or maybe even 40Hz sometimes. So this ring of focus (all of perception?) can vary from 3-30+ Hz for sure.<br>
<br>
I think the delta wave has to move in position from front to back of head resonating. It's like delta controls z axis, or delta breath and delta heartbeat z axis at two radially outward distances; alpha controls ring of focus.<br>
<br>
It needs that pulsing trace of heartbeat also to control heartbeat not just make you conscious thereof. Everything percepted is inertial. Everything percepted to be your action on world is you providing inertial force; everything percepted as sensation is affected upon your ring by outside force. What vantage point are you viewing it from (handedness). Complex 3d inertial changes with amplitude (and colors is overtones richness?).<br>
<br>
Whipping that ring of focus around from saggital, to coronal, to horizontal provides 4D (3D+T). And it needn't be a ring in brain moving saggital, to coronal, to horizontal - it can be about the same shape every time say in hot zone and it is the world via FOCUS that is being moved and spun to create 3D+T. Like how that spider spins the Styrofoam ball so well. Maybe that is how three (future, present, past) can be going at once because reverb or loopiness. <br>
<br>
I think if you could display that ring into screen from hot zone if spatially drawn rather than code drawn, then I think it (they) would jive with the percept I was having (be identical to), but minus gamma.<br>
<br>
Maybe layers are for frequencies and where delta and precurser alpha ring moving waves intersect is where alpha circle gets traced moment by moment. Dunno.<br>
<br>
The stability of the percept sphere does come about thru the usually undiscerned passage of world thru 3d squiggly ring of fire focus via rotating world (like spider and Styrofoam ball) and scale. This passage rate is usually 10 Hz but can vary tremendously.<br>
<br>
You could trace out preception with 3D moving squiggly ring (possibly with image of context filled into ring).<br>
<br>
I think you read with your gamma. And that's why you drift in and out of the story. Because your focus main frequency is lower.<br>
<br>
Rings of Fire, Cogs of Time <br>
The Brain Waves Behind our (Perceptual) Existence <br>
<br>
Rings of Fire, Cogs of Inertia <br>
<br>
B/c we are moving thru space therefore we move through time slightly more slowly than or quicker than light. White is felt when there's an inertial compression in time or space by a charge; black, a rarefaction; red-blue opposition might be <br>
<br>
Rings Give you shape (spatial locational informational), time moving you forward gives you movement and all sense percepts.<br>
<br>
On visual it's the fovea enlarged that seems to have the loudest refresh rate.<br>
<br>
Cogs of Time pushing you into future could be nothing (just time between firings in hot zone) or it could be the path down into the cerebellum and back.<br>
<br>
Or could cerebellum be handling past and future (or rather, current time and further future time) and cerebrum handles current (or rather, nearer future). Would explain for size difference in future/past vs larger present. I didn't really see three rings this time - more like one main ring - and how it's changes and deformations were the existence (focal) I was experiencing!! - but I did sometimes see a trail of say 10-20 onion skin layers of decided ring of focus ie spanning from paster to futurer rings of focus but really one main current ring and the afterburn of all the paster layers.<br>
