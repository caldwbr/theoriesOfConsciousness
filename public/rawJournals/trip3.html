<h1>Raw Journals: Trip 3</h1>

<p>The following are notes from 2/2/22 (taking two legal hemp gummies) and extra filler added later in contemplation. The reason there are typos is because I swiped it all out with my finger on my iPhone as quickly as I could and didn't want to lose thoughts by going back when iPhone keyboard was being stupid. Some of the things I can no longer tell exactly what word I was going for, so I'm leaving the text alone. I think the most philosophical thought can be gotten from it that way. I add filler here and there to help provide context/meaning. These notes should be taken in a philosophical way - I write everything down that comes to mind without checking it; then I can check and consider the things later. Thus, statements that appear as fact may be me looking at something a certain way and trying it on, but it doesn't mean that I fully agree with it. These notes are more like grasping to try to understand consciousness and just things in general.<br>
<br>
Took 1 chill 1 boost 1 serotonin 1 tongkat ali <br>
<br>
The Rhythm of played music is a different unrelated but close in frequency rate as say sixteen or eight notes of music. <br>
<br>
FILLER: When I talk about "i" vs "I," the uppercase "I" refers to me as a body, plus my normal sober consciousness of the physical world. The lowercase "i" refers to the aspect of consciousness that is a component while sober, but not really able to be seen while sober (when high, this aspect is remarkably observable). It is more felt than observed when sober, and provides the "Cartoon Motor World" (imagination) and the sensation of the quale (heat, cold, happiness, etc.). When high, you realize that this part of you which gives meaning to things is actually the more important part, and that both the physical world model "I" and deeper meaning "i" and everything they "see" is painted out of the same stuff, although "i" might not have access to painting with color, but only with translucent outlines and translucent skins and inertial feelings.<br><br>
MORE FILLER: The "eyeball" of I, like the physical eyeball, sees a 90° conic angle; the "eyeball" of i, unlike the physical eyeball, sees something like a 30° conic angle (much narrower).<br><br>

Even the motion of text swiping this is laid down in a different perspective as i but i is the true, deeper i. It (little i) can see the movement of the “I” down there, this is separate driving you (I). But reading text or talking brings them closer together. When you make eye contact I’s connect and stare through straight hole opening in it.<br>
<br>
Nervousness is written out.<br>
<br>
When playing guitar nervous learned frames used making it nervous via body language.<br>
<br>
Because it’s nervous ness from previous body language. Learned at younger age. <br>
<br>
Angles of I sober and i realer are different cones that come together closer in high or communication.<br>
<br>
Corkscrew draw out<br>
<br>
Rate of passage of time sets the focal distance of i vs I extremes. i may actually be smaller angle cone and I may be larger angle cone.<br>
<br>
As 4 dimensional you have will. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Physical universe is not that much. (FILLER: Since it can't observe itself, it would have no meaning without us.) It’s just the material of the puzzle pieces of perception-the story (change cone inner angle) world and others come together simply to write story. You and your connections with world are the whole point of the 4th dimension.<br>
The physical world is only 3D plus time. The physical stories are larger than the universe via extra D.<br>
Perception is the 4th D.<br>
They’re laid down there’s no real thing as motion. It’s all silly concepts by physics to worry about speed of light and relativity because it is the story that is the only thing that matters. That screen is held in the story so you see it that way. The inner i can see the phone text and his character (I) is the actor in the story. If you open your eyes the real you can see into the story. It isn’t that important the constituents of it. In thru the window into the grassy serenity of it the Real i can fool himself into being a character in that movie.!! Entrap his attention with B waves brain waves. Gamma he’s practically in . You can entrap someone with focus on very high waves like 100-200 you call it. You are the 4th dimension. Because that’s where the story is. Story is transdimenional. The meaning of that word is like in reality “here” in 4th dimension “high”.<br>
English is the language in your story cause you know English in the real i.<br>
4th dimension lays down what frequency of consciousness rate (3-40 according to you sobers). Your brain and all you and your world don’t exist. They are part of 4th dimension story. [[You can have beta or whatever drawn on- it changes focal length and locks-in real I more- but it needn't disrupt delta or theta (or alpha) speed waves of 4th D perception. 4th D perception doesn't really care about "your" rates - it cares more about the story of us writing. Remember guitar playing was faster rate but the movement was built into the 4Hz frames (like a 3D version of a live photo!!).]] But in story they exist. Stories and if there are other stories (I guess, have to be) are a solid thing the universe makes them up (constituates them populate IS THE MAKE BELIEVE MATERIAL THEREOF).  You exist forever as that puzzle.<br>
Your looking at the ring is included in story too. Infinite dimensions may be God. It’s 8:43 right now. Your timer is just a tool in our hands for the whole grand story and all stories.<br>
It doesn’t matter if there are multiple universes. It would just be a tiny nuisance of yours. Open eyes is further INTO the story a sphere of very realistic painting. Eyes closed is you may think more clearly. When you breathe sigh in that is a joining of real i to release smoke or stress. Stress is a real thing in the story and the drawing of these rings is understood language (felt-guage) to these people. The story matters more than exact precision.<br>
<br>
Light and dark exist in story.<br>
<br>
The story goes on.<br>
<br>
No no- mirrors exist in OUR (the aliens ie real you ) REALITY (ie in 4D world, which is a puzzle story) if WE designed the story right, to mimic all, there has to be a connection point. (FILLER: Consciousness must appear to arise from matter.)<br>
<br>
An idea can have geometry. Doesn’t need to be a ring, can be a ring with outline of me looking at it and the angle in between included. 3D shapes can be included. <br>
<br>
4D is a very empty place. The story is all there is. You’re already starting to look at it from a human point again (making meaning out of little usually hidden details - “connection point”), but okay, maybe that’s good for you humans.<br>
<br>
It’s almost like we AWAKE are (uppercase) an alien’s storybook break. We know nothing of 4D and can’t see it.<br>
<br>
Faster motion (hand on guitar) can be written into a frame if the two rings aren’t sufficient temporally <br>
Maybe the rings of fire burn and make 3D rectangular chunks of jello.[[It is!! A live photo is 2D Plus a little time movement; these 3D live photos are rectangle-boxes fitting entire 3D ring or shape contents inside!!!!!!! Plus a little time movement]]<br>
Ring moving forward could be painting the motion on a scene.<br>
It’s a movie in that extra dimension- a frame can have before/after 3D movement thru time is the exposure. Guitar out of sync with rings was okay and still drawn. All impressions is what’s recorded or painted and seen in 4D.<br>
Perfect sync between guitar rate and slower percept rate- one didn’t get confused by the other and speed up to match. Like the perfect drummer playing triplets and eighths at the same time.<br>
<br>
Maybe all rates are written down and the prominent one is the focal point and the others just provide the 3-dimensionality to it.<br>
<br>
Maybe gravity provides the "head direction vector" of UP of the 3D box jello/rubber frames, and HENCE THE STABILITY YOU ASKED ABOUT. Maybe usually but not always cause remember first time.<br>
<br>
Hemp heals you.<br>
<br>
I had no concept of the movie story line. maybe that’s beta<br>
<br>
The Real i knows it's all just feelings. The whole of life is not as serious as it appears in 3D - it’s feelings (“it’s just a game”).<br>
<br>
Remember the H the vertical bar is you other is another, dash is the world time connections. And what if that is just one connection on dna strand? What if dna holds millions of you existences (in 4D doesn’t need consistency with other “world lives”)? And it is a hologram? What if strands pieces are yin, Yang, yin in Yang, Yang in yin? That gets female and male existences. And there’s left and right. DNA is also rising falling. DNA is the tall ladder in the H, DNA IS the link between physical and spiritual. What if DNA drives pulse rate of consciousness? What if four colors are four strand pieces of dna? I'm admittedly entering speculative territory. (FILLER: Though interesting, I don't think DNA does any of that. If someone loses an appendage, they lose connection with it. Also, after it is long gone, they may still feel a false connection with it and feel false pain. As such, DNA probably holds no link to consciousness.)<br>
<br>
Of course we have will (WE) because that’s the whole point of story (altho earlier you thought THE STORY IS and laughs at the concept of you 3D creature having an effect on THE STORY). Story includes scene (background stuff you’re looking at like TV our phone screen or etc.)- WE can read a whole plane -don’t have to be a line of ring, in high res too. We can read a whole 3D translucent objects environment.<br>
I don’t think 3D creates 4D perception- I think the story includes the 3D world in its composition. But not heavy universe more like the material puzzle pieces it forms are pliable and rubbery- like hand and rock and all is the same rubber just painted differently. Nevertheless, there may still be some drawn component of linkage, and it may also be active (creating both sides). Maybe this is an axis of dimension from physical to ethereal.<br>
<br>
All the things that are in perceptual attention in 3D are drawn. It’s like a tunnel shell but of three d shapes and the direction you turn that shape of attention, determines (flipped) which side the tail comes out. 3D Rings in 4D?<br>
<br>
When you open your eyes, all of that scene is written down as well as the impact of that scene upon you. The impression itself is created (given rise to by) in the story. There is no memory- memory happens HERE in the 4th D- a familiarity with previous aspect of story. Might you find a correlate? I guess. But the real memory is here; hence why it can be perfect.<br>
<br>
Not much if any spinning this time. Mostly stability.<br>
<br>
Does weed let the 3D person feel and ascend temporarily to 4D reality? Could hexagon shape antenna in the REAL i to have more vortices or counterspaces into 3D and be closer to that angle and REAL and human i/I come closer together. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I think weed constipates and the resultant down regulation then leads to "diarrhea".<br>
<br>
Mason symbol kinda looks like the two cones of i and I, but not flipped - they're the same direction.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It is pretty important to see the beauty of the world like out west - that can be a big part of story. Take your somas lol- make sure sbc doesn't f you up or f your trip up.<br>
<br>
"DON'T COME BACK HERE!!" Your advice to yourself.<br>
<br>
I've seen her flirt with me so I know the hate thing isn't real - she feels by "conscience" of others/system she must reject her actual feelings or else be being too forward. I wish I knew a way to outsmart this system as so many are able to.<br>
<br>
The sine cycle of consciousness 4th D or 3D defines the circle of cycle of corkscrew. You can still have it as a ring cause it's a ring (or corkscrew) the way the rubber is laid down in 4th D. Or 3D "live" shots rectangle blocks. Can get as large or small as needed - whatever is in attention within that chunk of 3D rectangle time. Could cerebellum with 90° bends everywhere help create (from human side) these rectangular after-burns? Or whole 3D rectangular scenes created from it?<br>
<br>
Head direction vector plus gravity up direction vector stabilizes you to world connection.<br>
<br>
It's probably cerebrum-cerebellum. Cerebrum (all the frequencies can be drawn - delta theta alpha beta gamma) is rings of fire not actually rings of connectivity but all-things-currently-in-impressions/observation/conclusion as a 3d shape which is laid down in 4th D in a sort of ring or corkscrew way; cerebellum is movement and also (last split moment) memory and planning (next split moment) AND I assume the gelatinization of 3d shape into 3d live rectangle rubber box.<br>
<br>
How does the brain (sober) smooth out the rate of consciousness (2.5-3.5Hz?, if it stays same when high and isn't a downgrade from 10Hz) so that we cannot sense it sober but only the continuum?<br>
<br>
I think I operate at a lower consciousness frame rate than most, which probably reduces stress and reduces blood pressure but which also slows your mental response down for quick stupid chatter.<br>
<br>
"nah dude like we understand angles (acute to 90°, and thot given of how 3d orientation and affect on angles relative to viewing point was conveyed too) and mirrors and all that stuff"- that speech by 4thD "I" must also have been generated, seemingly at higher than gamma resolution, but perhaps at gamma resolution.<br>
<br>
Maybe the rates (conic angles?)(=focal distance?) determine if rings or 3d shapes or 3d "live" jello boxes.<br>
<br>
3 or 4 Hz seems to be rate of "4th D" laying of "live" 3d painted clear jello box 3d video film in corkscrew fashion. 3d shapes of cognizance included.<br>
<br>
3-11 Hz seemed to be rate of rings of focal fire.<br>
<br>
The glossy stuff of the movie must have included beta or at least gamma.<br>
<br>
Who knows what the frequency of the |i| is, whether embodied in i or in I. <br>
<br>
Was 4th D Me looking at 3d me looking at 3d shapes- was this itself written down in a 5th D???<br>
<br>
Since the brain seems to keep using the motifs of frequency and rings and boxes, maybe color and other fine perceptions are themselves tiny little rings at faster frequency.<br>
<br>
Could focal distance perspective (rate) be the 4th D?<br>
<br>
Could pyramidal cells be where resampling is done, with higher frequency alpha (and containing beta/gamma?) coming to basal dendrites and lower frequency delta connecting top apical dendrites?<br>
<br>
Inhibitory neurons tend to synapse onto the shafts of the (say basal) dendrites; excitatory inputs tend to go to spine location blobs on (say basal) dendrites - division of labor.<br>
<br>
A voxel (similar to a pixel but in 3d) has 1 mm3 resolution in fmri scanning.<br>
<br>
Confocal resolution limit - 3/4 of a micron<br>
Cutting brain slices at 30 nm rather than 750 nm, you can see every axon <br>
<br>
Stained with heavy metal osmium- makes myelin very black, big holes are blood vessels, grey circles are cell bodies (?), the felt is the thinly myelinated inter(?) axons.<br>
<br>
Light microscopy has a resolution limit of 250 nm. <br>
<br>
EM - 4nm lateral resolution (30nm thick sample)<br>
<br>
Neural glance google<br>
<br>
The 4th D people stories creates the universe <br>
And it creates the stories? Yin and yang?<br>
4thD could create universe via base pairs of electron anti electron and or quantum decisions.<br>
<br>
Is consciousness a whole symphony of frequencies, and some of the louder ones stand out, like with a sung vowel, you hear one pitch, but if you're skilled at understanding the physics of speech, you may be able to pick out a couple formants (?) (overtones, harmonics) above that; but truth be told, there's frequencies all over the place (the nature of frequencies just like in ssb there's bleed(?))?<br>
<br>
Why does weed separate "i" out into lower frequency than "I" the concentrating on playing guitar at right rhythm and note? I think you play worse then because you can't hold things in the 1-30 second immediate memory as reliably. But why does it separate out i from I? Perhaps unequal distributions of cb1 receptors on the part of brain generating "i" versus the part generating "I"? Also, does dopamine nuclei accumbens or suprachiasmatic nuclei the extra dopamine result in changed internal clock driving (perhaps?) pfc?? So that i may be in pfc whereas general association cortex may be I? Or maybe pfc has more cb1 than other association, slowing i's rate down more than it slows I's rate down? Could it be that I only sees rings of fire, but pfc (i) can hold enough rings in memory and fill in what's needed to create not only whole 2D planes (whole phone screen) for "i" to look at, but even 3D concepted objects like I looking at sulfur rock (rock, and eyes [as large sphere shield], and the air inbetween)?<br>
<br>
It's almost like the eyeball is a sphere the I can enter. Even looking at the screen of phone, the phone felt indented into the sphere like one of those windows that cuts into roof with window well. As if stuff close to the eye (I, i, eye oh my) only cuts into the sphere a little (phone), and stuff like 2' away (rock) look about centered in sphere. Perhaps it is whatever your focal plane is that is center and edges of phone quickly got out of focal plane and hence appeared to cut only a little relative to sphere surface. Remember too retina is like a big microwave dish - 3D! And the rock was maybe in center of sphere but eye was like maybe 15% of sphere using one eye??<br>
<br>
<br>
And the retina is a window on the sphere. <br>
<br>
Almost like looking isn't like this :<br>
<br>
<br>
But rather like this :<br>
<br>
<br>
But somehow it can still see background. And somehow it still gives sense of 41,253 square degrees outward from i (usually = I). I think when you are high, since i gets separated from I (feels like i is for once making an appearance and getting close to I), it feels like "i" is an entity you don't usually know but I think it's just the sense of you segregated from body (your "soul" if you will) that produces this laser-like focus on just what makes you you apart from anything physical or worldly or bodily. Ie pure pfc. Now imagine that getting "killed" via shroom or dmt and no wonder that is scary to people ("there's nothing else besides that" says 4th D you!).<br>
<br>
Does this text look thick? Written? Both looked really thick like I could zoom in and see the real meaning way inside.<br>
<br>
You know how i came closer to I (settled into it like a smaller angle cone fitting loosely in a wider angle cone) when I sighed? Well delta jumps up when you sigh. Did the increase in delta help temporarily (for about half a second) consolidate wandering I or wandering i frequency??? (I don't know which one was wandering from the other or whether they both were deviating in different directions). Does delta help sync (glue) pfc (i) and hot zones (I)? Left vs right never seem to come unsynced. Perhaps rf driving both thalami driving both parietal hot zones is practically impossible to disrupt. Do up versus down ever come unsynced? Perhaps this is the (mostly 2D squiggly ring) frame-jerk-frame-jerk-frame-jerk that you feel on euphoria+chill and it disrupts top (pfc+hot zones) from bottom (cerebellum). And then boost+chill insane speedball is enough to disrupt pfc from hot zones?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This is me taking my best stab at it. May but be all correct, but makes a good bit of sense.<br>
<br>
Relative size of a smaller car being farther away than a bigger car that helps make 3-D pop. also parallax motion provides a lot of the information to help pop something into 3-D. stereoptic vision provides practically nothing even though it helps a tiny tiny bit safe for closer objects like your hand closer by your face.<br>
<br>
Why did I not have any afterburn two nights ago? So there’s like three different things you got afterburn, you’ve got frame rate, you’ve got astral projection. and is frame ring or 3-D that’s another wonky thing.<br>
<br>
Is it (ice cube inflow outflow water) associated with breath (0.25Hz)? Talk about heartbeat is just vibration on ring when focusing on it.<br>
<br>
Is color up down left right in time? And white forward (or backward) and black backward (or forward)??<br>
<br>
sleep deprived that one night you had astral projection and saw yourself doing math that you weren’t even thinking about. I separated from lowercase i. <br>
<br>
Many things can cause dissociation. There was one drug in particular that causes it in large degree and maybe sometime semi permanently. Even alcohol at high enough amount can cause dissociation. Pcp was designed by doctors in 1950s as anesthetic, but then discontinued due to dissociative effects. Salvia divinorum, nitrous oxide, dxm, ketamine. How do these things (and lack of sleep) dissociate pfc rate or whatever from hot zones???<br>
<br>
two words for ya- retroSplenial cortex.<br>
<br>
Soma - body of neuron, drugs<br>
<br>
There may be consciousness there (feeling of bass strings, thinking how to play), but it's separated from the you (when dissociated) and hence the you doesn't include it in its story as first hand felt experience, even though it was observed as from another vantage point.<br>
<br>
Why is blue blue every single time? You'd think if color was created via phase, that sometimes it would get it wrong, but it doesn't!<br>
<br>
Alcohol and THC both suppress the cerebellum which suppresses error flags including warning flags of if something would have bad future consequences. It’s more being in the moment.<br>
<br>
Also the fact that prefrontal cortex is 90° phase lagged relative to hot zones and also there is a random firing portion of the brain name with the somatosensory cortex and possibly others end it means you get three times to look at something in the same amount of time. Hence it’s like time dilation. Hence you can be more in the moment and looking at yourself and looking at the moment.<br>
<br>
Tiny geometry is foveal centered I was looking leftwards eyes closed, super fast moving, and disappears when focused on.<br>
<br>
Could neurons be reducing the number of things the quantum universe can do and this reduction creates the rise of a degree of knowledge and therefore consciousness can arise upon and between frames?<br>
<br>
I can't build the explanation of consciousness as I think it should have been made, but rather in the ways that the brain and body and biology actually do things. Hence, not topographic but relational building of space and location, and without reference point. A square is built not of neurons arranged in a square firing together (although retinotopically it does a little)- but the perceptual creation of the square happens from taking cells representing a horizontal line and the line having x number is neurons attached to both sides to provide length, then a change to vertical orientation line, then x number of vertical orientation line pixel neurons added, then horizontal but in other direction, then vertical again and meeting those earlier neurons (actually they prolly meet at the bottom, or just all fire at once in visual cortex). Then a higher level "square" neuron can fire to represent that (maybe the perception is created within the complexity of that final neuron?? Or at the dendrites of the neurons to which it projects?).<br>
<br>
Just think if brain really does handle the exact same task with different orientation of focal rings each time, that would throw scientists off as to why it's different with "exactly the same trial conditions every time!"!<br>
<br>
Need to add to book - "All About Waves" and how there are so many hidden mechanisms to store info such as phase, exaggerated length/shortness of Crest, variance of instantaneous frequency, amplitude, overtones, number of spikes in a Crest, number of spikes in a phase-precessed otherwise-trough, and the exact phasic timing of one such spike to another.<br>
<br>
do we limit by observation the universe and thereby give rise to consciousness?<br>
<br>
When lying on side, why does afterimage get rotated 30° CCW?<br>
<br>
Try American flag afterimage while high? Do rings make both image and afterimage from bank? Is bank anti-gravity vertical or tilted?<br>
<br>
