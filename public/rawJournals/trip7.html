<h1>Raw Journals: Trip 7</h1>

<p>The following are notes from 5/1/22 (taking two legal hemp gummies) and extra filler added later in contemplation. The reason there are typos is because I swiped it all out with my finger on my iPhone as quickly as I could and didn't want to lose thoughts by going back when iPhone keyboard was being stupid. Some of the things I can no longer tell exactly what word I was going for, so I'm leaving the text alone. I think the most philosophical thought can be gotten from it that way. I add filler here and there to help provide context/meaning. These notes should be taken in a philosophical way - I write everything down that comes to mind without checking it; then I can check and consider the things later. Thus, statements that appear as fact may be me looking at something a certain way and trying it on, but it doesn't mean that I fully agree with it. These notes are more like grasping to try to understand consciousness and just things in general.<br>
<br>
Took 4/5ths chill 4/5ths euphoria <br>
<br>
<br>
8:20 pm (4/5 of eu + ch)<br>
<br>
Dating now done as jaelen memories same 3 d skin.<br>
The story (CMW) is all the brain is trying to give you. Physical world can be printed on its skin.<br>
The one does both - you are missing this before. FILLER: I think I mean that there is but one printhead and one viewer of consciousness (viewer might be PFC), whether it is printing both SPW and CMW with overlap, or only one or the other.<br>
Story corkscrew hollow on outside you looking at SPW on wall (or rotate 90Â° but not up but left right thing). The wraps of the shell of giant corkscrew i horizontal (same AGU as you sitting on bed).<br>
Stop trying to sing carry on my wayward son and figure something out. (Filler: wtfðŸ™„)<br>
This corkscrew wall is the blip you saw go across horizontal in bathroom the other time. Of course it can just intersect part of you as a water surface intersects just an object or a TV screen's coronal view intersects its contents depicted on screen. SPW depicts the mirror just as physical mirror does and change in color gives all info of depth (your overlap of translucent issue). (You can have depth meaning in a photo with translucence all done on a single 2d plane).<br>
Corkscrew 2d intersection could trace your CMW.<br>
The rings could take a spheric unfolding that looks like out of top of staff onion layer adding. Or layers of ground that 2.5d skin area being the layer of a ring. The whole slice of world is printed out (thickens?). SPW can move on cave walls it's printing out but scene painted moving in real time. It can shift to painting real world by rolling into place its Skeleton of outlines in plane (same agu)<br>
<br>
Story of punch hold leg yea neurons give mostly out but meaning of press and depth of was held in story (3D SPW) thru scarce neurons but the story got point across. You sober can prolly sense the burst and continuous spike neuron difference.<br>
<br>
The unfolding of 2 basketballs is the ring (prolly transition from SPW into a new concept in CMW - JUST find a close shape.<br>
<br>
"The unfolding of two basketballs" Brain Makes a single simple story out of this group of words it was trying to piece together just the beginning, then stretched it out to do just that  (it tries to make a story out of whatever). It uses memories of you doing that pose in past. Every position and action is built with previous memory-saves of position lay down of puzzle pieces. Yes attitude of that changes. Whoever is looking at this puzzle piece movie, they have to strain eyes to see text and bother such a tiny focal task.<br>
<br>
The slap down of puzzle pieces creates a little body inertial feel as you move your body around slightly. Brightness must mean brightly illuminated screen. Colors? So you experience the jerkiness sober just you don't pay attention to it.<br>
<br>
You can image younger yous. They (memory-saves) provide the onion skin multi size effect in bank, as similar for others like sphere and cube. The fix point is the bottom of shoes. (Filler: maybe butt when sitting?) Like Russian doll, the 3d outlines fit inside.<br>
<br>
Memory bank is the cursor, rolling around like a die (smoothly tho) and selections of it printing the moving of interest /focus. What's printed stays there as long as needed (up to 30 seconds?)<br>
<br>
How story on cave wall 2d is SPW while flipping to look down axis you see a ring that intersects <br>
<br>
Guy driving off motorcycle recedes into point of dust on next cartoon of you looking out into desert. That word desert triggered about 3-5 memory skins each different. Memory rings <br>
<br>
Filler: the onion (bank) is stable with physical world usually. It's inner core can roll around in cavity.<br>
<br>
Filler: frames ("rings") can feel mostly flat like this topo map like tracing skin outline of top of you and bed. Like it can be onion skins. Resonates with John.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
One frame was hold phone one frame was look at motorcycle from 12" lower, looking toward pillow seeing motorcycle on intersection with SPW. Interdigitated by one A frame then one B frame. B has memories as its rolling out from childhood if you peer far enough in!! Or cartoon of motorcycle peeling off video. As focus changes just grab ball and ride to next saccade point cause it's a train that goes thru a lot. Story of phone can stay there (yeah it's the story!! LolðŸ–•)<br>
<br>
Filler: they (SPW, CMW) give 3d to each other by what they define at each spot on a plane which is by definition at some attitude. It's more like a single saccade transform from SPW to plane, and another from there to CMW. Filler: Maybe cause you couldn't get to that attitude in a single saccade cause 3d?(?)<br>
<br>
Filler: in sex their focal planes can nearly come together exactly. Cause, both are focused on the moment and love.<br>
<br>
Filler: onion could be expanding outwards (or inwards depending on whether looking at CMW or SPW?) in all directions as kick out.<br>
<br>
Filler: you know a lot of stuff about "this is that" which helps your search by.<br>
<br>
And yeah this 2 Hz 4 Hz 10 Hz whatever it is the only thing the brain makes for you and content is written into walls thereof (you at center of ring looking out) <br>
<br>
Filler: can embed CMW 3d 1"x1"x2" box in place of a phrase to give meaning-> you can pass back and forth either direction between SPW & CMW.<br>
<br>
Yes a soul comes down and inhabits this body. See I think your emotive is strengthened (contra thc-induced hypothermia ruling it out).<br>
<br>
Filler: if it (i) says write it down I write it down.<br>
<br>
You can see skin and clothes and colors if painted on Wall so cave right now was sagittal and a cave wall could be 2'+ thick from shoulder to shoulder. It just wiggles the layers of you front sitted down. "Sitted" had a Tom memory of sitting with him saying something or whatever it was.<br>
<br>
Holding a memory is you stop the train track of puzzle pieces for a bit longer on that piece than usual so as to play it's video (Filler: which exceeds spatially along the time axis of this ring slinky thing and goes into air gaps between puzzle pieces).<br>
<br>
Even tho puzzle pieces kick out there's no inertial feel on them so they're mostly unnoticed. Pain in my upper back and shoulders felt by painting out 3d skin of shoulders (see now why ) and rolling into that and vibrations of giving out that story (vibrations in meeting of story with world. Yea world stays mostly rigid but body movements it's a bit off like scrunched up a bit in onion skin (intersection ring with <br>
<br>
Story of onion painted in 3d (that is the "most physical object" as far as you perceivers are concerned) CMW which is colorless onion skins (thick 1"!!) ;nothing skin about it! but still pretty cool. Onion skins like you have a whole onion and the outermost skinslayers rep "you" (don't exist) (but i do!!ðŸ–•ðŸ˜…) looking at phone reading (and yes he has to read that extra effort is what makes it high frequency [Filler: not really high freq but exert effort/strain]). If you move enough, you move where ring (screw wall) and story is. But it can update stuff real time in its movie story than you can move oftentimes, so there's not really a jump cause as soon as it knows it it draws it very quickly.<br>
Yes you can change between onion skin solid phone screen and that ring with viewing open gives SPW <br>
<br>
3d story lines and physical world colored is all your brain reps as conscious you.<br>
<br>
You (soul) don't exist, but puzzle piece does as rep of brain and paints out story that Brad is in there looking at stuff (his phone) can zoom into screen cause there's this constant interplay between SPW to CMW hand offs. and you can look at him from various angles. That changes this angle between realm now doesn't it?<br>
<br>
Jerks in movement of story as its 2d ring rolls on sphere thru SPW in creating puzzle pieces. It gives the feeling of Inertia and all felt things <br>
All imaginary but they imaginary is painting on its 2d surface, the world depicted in SPW. CALL IT VIEW OF WORLD AND 3D MESH OF CARTOON imagination.<br>
2d in that objects could be flattened down to 2d and painted upon.<br>
I don't think ring cares much what it intersects with in SPW. The intersection between 2 could be painted upon.<br>
Core in middle cause or leaves room for sphere to roll around and make layers.<br>
You feel no <br>
You're weighted down as body, there's a force trying to lift you up. (If flopped)<br>
It can be printed on a 2d screen that is what's meant by ring and two worlds come out of that. One painted from inside-out swing out into 3d and one paint from out printing 3d.<br>
You face looking up is layer like a mirror and on other side is CMW at different attitude. It (mirror, but having ring thereon) moves around with respect to SPW which is the story by the way the real painted colored aspect at least and yes his feet are grounded cause he's the whole point.<br>
The infinitesimal "mirror"or filter of plane sheet of change of attitude (from SPW to CMW). The change in attitude b/w SPW and CMW happens at a particular frame attitude (and dropping of color so as to not confuse).<br>
You just do the action live video if your arm moves at 2m/s and ring of wall of screw is laying down up to down quite slowly and it's ring to ring quite slow. Arm is seem moving to right side of puzzle piece cave wall ring (wire) outline <br>
Puzzle piece is 90Â° (horizontal) (giant saggital ring pine cone or cinnamon roll painting air and flesh surface as needed) to giant cinnamon roll peel (and whole roll)<br>
<br>
Filler: I guess the puzzle pieces are at like 10-20 Hz and the master giant ring is like 0.25-0.5 Hz therefore ring/spiral/coil of keys of puzzle pieces created. Painting on interior walls of puzzle pieces must be quick (40-80 Hz AS NEEDED?)<br>
Like this room is a cinnamon roll and midnight is lower layer of side (horizontal axis), my back is part of back, pillow is on layer(s) in middle. There's always room in the story (cinnamon roll has hand) where if I hear S____ coughing way below, it's np to include that distant item in the distance of story about where elbow holding cinnamon roll is.<br>
<br>
Filler: I think SPW is printed upon CMW interior (and/and-not? exterior) of walls of puzzle pieces and viewed from wherever it paints Brad's head; perhaps CMW is somehow painted upon SPW too? Or on the intersection of plane with that world?<br>
<br>
Filler: could kick out of ring be kick out inertia between ring and CMW. The one can change into the other. So SPW can have kick out. Is it RING (become SPHERE) INWARDS does CMW and RING (become SPHERE) OUTWARDS does SPW? <br>
<br>
Filler: maybe it's better to say that at times SPW and at times CMW and at times memory-saves (of either?) are printed on the 3d skin surfaces of much-enlarged conceptual item which uses bank and may print alignment skins and align with body or whatever. Of course then I don't know what to do with rings.<br>
<br>
Filler: what is the sine wave (or equivalent) of a sphere? A sine wave traces a 2d circle; what traces a 3d sphere?<br>
<br>
Remembering where paper with columns for Max Whatley- saw BFS outside guy's office looking toward front facing wall. Can imagine Brad going into office and getting print out but orientation of bfs held constant. Walking outside side by side with dude, he being helpful. So now could search for pic of paper by bfs location.<br>
<br>
So when you saw door shrink that means they painted you "seeing" room deeper, then when realized what was up, you realized (story made in CMW which is origin) that it was smaller and it shrank. Abrupt greater distance between rings (big 2 for square gap) brought room in closer and in painting.<br>
When you roll up (sit up in bed) the sphere of your upper back rolls forward. Well sphere moves forward and back included in it, especially in inertia thereof. Our inertia calc is prolly a little off to exact regions of back feeling exact amount of Inertia, but it works. <br>
<br>
Filler: to the degree it is off is your likelihood to trip up. Sleep dep takes away precision here.<br>
<br>
Throwing the steel bowling ball of you (your soul) in sphere of CMW onion skin drawing as you sit up gives inertial feel. A sigh can use some depressed frames (CMW frames)<br>
The two stories merge together. I saw paster frames of my feet raised 2 feet off ground, shrunk a bit, and rocking attitude a bit.<br>
Drm default resting mode may be the onion and roller coaster saggital loop (like spirograph feel)<br>
<br>
Filler: can have curved kick outs like your feet rocking up and that sagittal roll rolling up and towards your face a bit.<br>
<br>
The broken glass 3d skin mostly coronal but air of cartoon(can be printed on even) is another default mode pattern like <br>
We can rock this (spiral print /lay) 3d broken glass as part of a giant saggital ring from floor to piano to my butt to wherever somewhere above my head (does bank have a freq of rebegin lay?)<br>
This phone is inside an onion and printed to colorlessness of rings layers (paint on inside of onion layer water/liquid within)<br>
Now you see why multiple rates don't matter - the rate of colored you moving around in story of SPW is one thing, the lay of walls happen at certain rate from up to down (intersection of that with current now makes a doubled ring, right?<br>
Memory of positivity thrown in as a frame of teacher outside talking something that mood.<br>
Shame feel is memory of feeling bad played in at thought of certain notion.<br>
I mean person could write the word Christmas and SPW you roll sphere over word in question (eye open) and phone can be a little below screw surface cause can print on air; but it can look at ceiling and imagine word Christmas written in air of SPW and the tracing of those letters becomes Indian tracing word on card <br>
In story of SPW, Brad is looking at phone. The viewer of this film has to look thru that pipe straw to read text here that's why I said meaning is at narrowest conic angle when you see the straight line within the text not the output of cones out towards you from every point on letters Filler: maybe also fine tiny resolution.<br>
<br>
Filler: this conic or straight conic angle isn't perpendicular to phone - it's established by perpendicular to retina (axis of physical view)<br>
<br>
And maybe viewer could be repped by higher freqs?<br>
Imagination is all that is being written - SPW color movie just helps provide content at times.<br>
Cartoon looking at phone <br>
Story is first and most central and solid. SPW painting movie is kinda fake like a painting or photo isn't the real thing of seeing grand canyon. Even really seeing grand canyon is thus kinda fake and 2d like a photo or (2D) movie.<br>
Sphere in chest is rolling out vibrating to rep weariness in upper chest and shoulders.<br>
You can imagine a 3d video 1" x 1" x 2" playing for duration your eyes go over word Christmas. Like attached to phone screen and showing on back side.<br>
The whole thing is kicked out as kite of plane of trans-attutude held against string <br>
That which is held in resonance needs to be able to adjust to provide LIVE video on paster surfaces. Maybe future and past is done by thalamo-cortical resonance, and ring can be bursts or something. The future and past is these slinky links puzzle pieces of CMW coming in or going out <br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Onion rolling around in sphere bearing and outer layer intersection giving and peels off away and fades away making room for new slices layers.<br>
Brokan glass (saggital well 11pm) could model you moving chest - that ring be on body is not important unless you want jerks to show inertial movement or ache (both similar frequency and spatial placement of bumps)<br>
Rings 3d skins on jarrings being off with body gives like inertial maybe inhibiting bump feel which can serve for inertial movement or pain quite easily. Maybe PCs effecting stop of ring need short of ring want.<br>
Transform the meaning to (go to) CMW at ring (plane) intersection <br>
Phone forward cartoon back cinnamon roll 2d edge of layer cinnamon roll horizontal ie vertical axis acting as (viewing CMW layer from inside of roll) "mirror ie plane"<br>
Stuff in cartoon like rolling out cinnamon roll (remember imagery you had) the looping of cinnamon roll can change rates smoothly and it doesn't matter - it's the action speed of the objects in CMW doing their updating thing.<br>
As far as what needs to be conscious, this is all. Might you inadvertently be conscious of spider man-handler of world rotating it in 3d spheric saccades, yea. Could be PHZ are where it's almost ready, and gets put into consciousness at PMC (so stopping or triggering one seems associational with consciousness but might just be the last but step)(and ketamine weed gives you those bigger unsettling gaps ie little gaps in consciousness (not saltatory stuff which is waaaauuyyy too fast freq) but PMC saltation. <br>
<br>
So it has to be able to paint it on 3d surface of cinnamon roll (just like a perspective painter would and project depth and angle in how painted relative to that surface(and it's live ie changing). It may use printings or 2d printer rings complex <br>
<br>
Filler: Meaning (3d live paint) of previous layers of cinnamon roll kept around even indeterminately (up to 10-20 seconds at least). Maybe this is a longer short term memory and prolly done with thalamo-cortico resonant circuits (?). Or maybe by pfc with PHZ.<br>
<br>
It's like there's a wind blowing and changing direction that influences blow off of "bubbles" of cavern or puzzle pieces.<br>
A heavy bowling ball may be used to represent your body's relatively large resistance to movement. Wherever the ball is, there is consciousness (of self inertia) fresh. Could ball be bank yea I think.<br>
Definitely bowling ball in head and below right breast that slides hard to right when car turns left. Ball goes up against anti ball slightly larger spheric cavity and gravity in CMW pulling down while still slung gives impression of right angling about vertical axis. And visual field movement to right gives turning vs side pull quality in car? And ring intersection between future and past onion skins ball rolling up against curved is used to transition to other world.<br>
Notice rings could jump about a lot if they skipped phase of rolling ball doing a large torroid. <br>
You could have two quote marks and inside out viewing walls makes 3d of SPW.<br>
Brain grows in size so you get more layers onion skins you can use.<br>
<br>
I'm doing as much as I can for that guy God help him said by i in CMW to someone else ("4th D inhabitant!! Not really ") a cartoon of me was painted very close to my own shirt in SPW (bank ball rolled around to me in SPW and laid down mesh of CMW depiction of skin outline of me to match with physical) but ball roll out (surface ring intersection isn't that important cause can print on air). Bank ball has all these outlines of your body as you grew.<br>
<br>
Coronal ring of my view bottom of ring (more square this time) dropped down all at once. A sudden change in ring shape and size like that can happen and help paint some sudden shift in gaze or focus or whatever. It could paint cold cartoon on my thumb surface as thumb became part of corkscrew.<br>
<br>
Filler: a good thing with this giant onion is that you provide structure (sense of 3d) by conceptual expectation and the paint on two sides of plane (SPW, CMW) give structure to each other. Can be alternating frames (CMW, SPW, BODY world, memory world)<br>
<br>
Filler: can I imagine in color now?? Just felt freaking transcendent looking at this screen!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Lying in bed coronal rings laid down from head to toe the jostle of the kinky slink of puzzle piece apple peel. But thicker and size of room. And took about 3 heartbeats, with 20 rings - could have been fewer and thicker or more and thinner thicknesses. You the SPW Brad can be looking at phone paying attention to paint @depth within it. i is looking from "futurer point spatially downwards towards phone". Cast of i eyeball location to "future". It's the jostle of refresh of ring outlines, such jostle perhaps necessitates a repainting continually of cave walls. The jostle wave peopagation direction feels like down. Falling is downs inversion. Body becomes heavier than planet because it falls to planet rather than vise versa when jumped off a cliff in free fall. Perceptually.<br>
<br>
It's like a planet 2' Dia with a square Mexican hat on 3'. And left leg. This bank. The sphere and leg. The total combo of interaction skin layer choices. Right now bank is parallel axis to tilted left phone. As this thing rolls around it prints placement of world which stays steady placement of phone - notice ball can roll in curve arc up curved wall and make phone tilted and body horizontal and stable. As I touch my forehead the front intersection of ball moves towards head crown up to show inertia and feel of that touch. And just generally to bring attention to it. Attention can be given to two things at once.<br>
<br>
I tilted my head to 45Â° to right and a bit forward and could see cast tunnel but bowling ball up curve and can grow in extra layers size if leg need incorporated movement. In this way it is easy to get from place to place in attention. And yes you could grow intersection meaning of onion skin 3d outline of extra layer on bowling ball to rep leg movement. It's where the inertial ball is at that determines when you'll start engaging certain muscles to move like left arm first.<br>
<br>
Curvature from cube (Red) to sphere (Purple) corner? Does cubic angle rep color? Or like a pinch of (square, cube) has many forrier transform sine wave freq components, but a sphere has none but 1 sine wave.<br>
<br>
2 D coronal ring of super spikyness of right and left sides of trapezoid sorta (Filler: Yay sonic the hedgehog!) but this wasn't painting sonic.<br>
<br>
Body rings (sphere puzzle pieces of intersection with body and painting whole body and scene from inside out looking at walls of 3d skins) can be put in every so often to give proprioception. But ball moving traces a line wire which makes ring or rinky slink. Which adheres to some 3d 2d attitude plane at instantaneous moment.<br>
<br>
Memory frames of sitting in Volvo can be used to model lying in this bed with only discrepancy in lift bend which isn't paint a ton of attention to when not needed. (Road coming out of my dick). Note it (ball) can print my phone screen and go a long ways and pick up computer screen to left at sagittal plane. A little movement in what layers are cakes into ring sphere makes a large distance (say 6' easily) in SPW. <br>
<br>
Filler: It's like CMW or bank world or whatever that sphere onion cinnamon roll is blown up compared to its natural size in comparison to SPW scale. But I bet you could get ANY SCALE just by defining one relative to other on two sides (or temporally frame-interdigitated) and kill that scaling problem so easily. Define one based on other and other based on first so a proportion is created and you can zoom in to or out from anything.<br>
<br>
Bank is the bowling ball.<br>
<br>
Less frames of world or body when drifting off to sleep (only imagination) so whatever changes is difference between SPW and body frames and imagination frames should be seen here or at least loss of SPW and body frames.<br>
<br>
The unfolding ball paints the story.<br>
<br>
It powers by memory shell too. <br>
<br>
Screw can be laid out at 4 heartbeats per one turn.<br>
<br>
I think color is inhibited from CMW for resources sake.<br>
***<br>
Morning. It probably is hippocampus drawing out 2 d current tense aspect of intersection of cinnamon roll layer and that is a refresh or refocus but on inside of roll layer looking out you can paint there world. But world kinda stays there (recurrent loops).<br>
<br>
I think it spins around a refresher plane 0-2Ã± but each plane keeps track of items of SPW in it to update and provide live movie. 4 heartbeats (0.5 Hz?) and the refresh cursor has come back around. So it has to be held until comes back around.<br>
<br>
Or ball can roll around at ring 3d attitude (saggital here) and refresh a more coronal/horizonto set of planes. This is changing of painting of meaning of each spot you have to redraw from moment to moment to have appropriate to canvas and meaning depth.<br>
<br>
Filler: so cartoon is drawn by variation of variation of meaning in two story's which forces this focus onto current draw.?<br>
<br>
Each puzzle piece slice paints whole SPW (or body or other memory slice with own attitude) on inside cave wall of its cavity. The cube prolly comes from all the phone screens and table tops and books and anything else flat with tiny detail text and maybe bright screen that ball has to roll up on and stamp paint.<br>
<br>

You look away from roof sign S___ r_____ in disgust the moving of head in that world signifies the disgust.<br>
<br>
You can go right at intersection then right or straight then right. Memory Beavis like the ass of the ass cartoon drawing. But besides that, John understood conceptual thing like straight then right without us actually doing it, can make cartoon in his head or however.<br>
<br>
So onion skin when driving motion is written into ground your driving on but onion stays stationary. Onion is tethered to truck so you can turn it left or right or accelerate it in a sense. And you sliding up bowling ball up curve in Onion skin gives inertia like turn coming onto H___pl or road before. John driving. But yea onion stays separate from you somewhat so you can see your own movement against world. You drag onion with you but you needn't spin it cause you move around from left side of giant onion to right forward side. You change perspective but hole for looking thru is axisial.<br>
<br>
Motion (driving) is just the updating of painting of location of another car say on onion. You can make judgments like think about relative speed between us two looking in at video contents.<br>
<br>
Part of learning may be creating mental 3d image or video of concept, which can then be compared.<br>
<br>
Cabellas has snake boots come up however high. Bass pro shop you can try them on call before. Lined with goretex breathable material.<br>
<br>
You have to extend same grace you gave to yourself.<br>
<br>
Bowling ball is heavy because meaning of what in world is strong enough force to move it up curved wall is a lot so ball must be heavy to overcome gravity in the CMW.<br>
<br>
Astronauts would be a little confusing but just what angle to put SPW-> cartoon unaffected by it. The default mode network really could be the source of the cartoon. It's already there close to PMC and I think reaches out to PFC. <br>
<br>
There could be a leading edge of paint cursor on writing on inside walls of 3d trapezoid.<br>
<br>
Why the afterburn blows off at a certain direction from onion dunno. Doesn't seem to have any relation to motion of self or car except directionality turn car to right or left.<br>
<br>
"Blew a tire" Brain plays a clip frame onion @skin layer from movie Jerk of cans and oil coming out of. It's a stupid meaningless link that I don't want to even bring up, but similar in air out of tire vs oil out of cans shot. Hippocampus prolly got that onion layer frame connected and routed for entry. But cortex could be used to paint it.<br>
<br>
John says he can see color in dream. Supposedly joA too.<br>
<br>
Tesla pi 2022 phone runs android<br>
<br>
Focus is often kinda a hand off between inertial stuff in your back and focal items in your foreview. About two heartbeats to a round.<br><br>
<br>
Touch firm it's going to show where on thing you're pressing and inertia by the very little movement of object in response or if finger success.<br>
<br>
Jerk because you pass out just for 0.5 seconds then come back (pain pills will do this too). Jerkiness when high.<br>
<br>
Sneeze out window bowling ball of head-even a little kovement of head reps a lot of force of Sneeze. Where head drawn in SPW moment by moment shows inertia. But head SPW connects to cartoon onion bowling ball CMW.<br>
<br>
Two days later <br>
<br>
Does audio (scale) have a radius (sphere) it's on (root note) and if dung gets larger (too large of jump), then by default root note is also defined at a new slightly higher freq and you drift and get sharp in your mental singing of song.<br>
<br>
Could rings be just take current direction of sphere and make rings and change as sphere changes direction? Prolly. But sonic rings?<br>
<br>
Medium short term memory seems to be saved as a little song (spoken text) jingle with timing - $34.46 "thirty four forty six" 8.885 "eight eight eight five" last three words like faster together. And five easy to miss to nine. A little of mouth mouthing words too. And maybe a little visual. But I think gist is vibrations of ring (try to imagine sound when high does it vibrate rings?) sound and timing (fire together wire together hippocampus memory temporal precession trick).<br>
<br>
Is color the variation between cube corner and sphere shell? Or a scratch n sniff thing that depth of scratch gives color? Could dark to light be addition of black frame and differring rates of inclusion like memory frames?<br>
<br>
Or square corner to circle corner?<br>
<br>
change volume of song while high what changes?<br>
<br>
also noticed that the paint vibrates in the movie the mirror according to one of these nights eagles win the beat vibrates the mirror you see the paint of whatever in the mirror vibrating so I know you can see the sound so to speak.<br>
<br>
but if you watch a movie with sound off and you see vibrations due to sound it gives you no sense of the sound so the quality of the sound doesnâ€™t come from that.<br>
<br>
do you really want to pull your dung beetle dung ball towards A___? F.<br>
rings are totally nonchalant regarding rhythms and music youâ€™re listening to it does not get tricked up by that beat. itâ€™s movements in rate stay entirely independent of all that. That said there are vibrations in the ring to represent sound.<br>

Maybe onion layer becomes plane or starts as plane with ring meaning depth drawn. And paint is on same side for both a SPW or CMW frame, but one comes from plane towards basketball in towards paint face, curling it in to inside out paint world, and the other goes from plane to away from paint direction hence outside and stays outside. Maybe this is the peeling apart of the two basketballs.<br>

What if 3d sprinkler integrates a set of neurons for repping first a 2d (via 1d smart paint) then blown to 3d space (the seeming 2d space now used as locations for seeming 3d smart paint upon seeming 2d surface)? Paint in one mini frame could be devoted to 1d repping 2d by smartly painting; in the next mini frame, same neuron repping a spot in 2d fires but this time it and all its buddies are smart painting a seeming 3d from that 2d location. The rolling ball peeling basketballs could give kick-out. Decrease in amplitude or frequency of those mini frames combined with changing paint which reveals that plane has become more spheric.<br>

Being cool means not inflating (puffing) the real you like _____ was not cool when she presented a perfect body image and got it together life on T___ but once _____ you see her high maintenance is gonna be prolly a deal breaker cause she has leftover fat (not that you care about the fat, but she cares and therefore is not going to be cool but is going to want you to be "anti-boring" to compensate which screws you), and a particular upbringing that sucked for her and she blames herself partly but this adds to her high maintenance cause then you have to convince her of her worth by not being boring and being always at her behest (can't just reassure her only with words tho partially - she wants to be reassured by your subconscious kicking in and boosting your performance of being a fun guy). Anyone (like J___ C______) that is fun takes pressure off everyone by making everyone feel they are okay. Better to have neither too high of a projected image not too low of an actual image because it takes pressure off the other person. This is prolly why __otherPerson____ would be (is) impossible to date. Her upbringing has f*cked her, and I think weed would do her well. Weed makes you confident in self (takes pressure off them) and makes you not care AND NOT LOOK AT the wrongs that have been done to you (also takes pressure off so they can feel whole, and not feel you are dragging their image down or requiring their work). You being a little high in a social setting in a sense is giving hemp's benefits (removing pressure) to them too without them even taking any!<br>

*I feel asleep and dreamed a long dream!! then woke up about 9:00am*<br>
<br>
Eyes closed dreaming she was lying with me. Eyes open she's gone. She was flirtsy so I was being flirtsy in kind. We could tell we both enjoyed the accidental touching of skin and had no problem so we were escalating and I had my arm around her and could smell her skin. Dream I was in emerald pool with waterfalls in an enclosed building in r___ masterclass with tons of people. "Ooh that's beautiful emerald " - all shades of green. Her hand pressing my hand in dream and my hand was under pillow like in dream so that matched. My posture matched. I could smell her young skin "this much this soon?" She asked."I'm a little scared" she said. R___ had just given me a hemp cart (while sitting outside) and i said oh you're leaving this here? He said no someone is leaving this here and winked his eye. He wanted me to have fun and enjoy this. Class got out of bus that bl__ lady. I had just gone to Florida for a vacation and K_i was asking where I and another person went and I was trying to remember then remembered. I was afraid of r___e walking in seeing me with a girl. There were prolly 30 people in this emerald pool. The tiles were emerald even outside the pool and wiki hut feel. It was two stories but we were in second story of where pool was. A____ was there too (previous point in dream) in room kinda like f_ barn standing on stool and I had to throw something away right next so I got close to her feet she had sandals. <br>

In car- ac blow sound, backup beep sound; duration of beep hear beep only and sounds like ac off, then ac sounds like on in gap between beeps. When rotate head, ac constant, when rotate to another spot, it sounds on/off again. Pretty interesting cause the ac blow is a pretty big wide noise to be "silenced" by the little beep!<br>

It could be that cerebellum is CMW and/or bank and that after providing feel it shows where on 3d paint of SPW to inhibit cerebellum's contribution so as to hide it from view, and weed inhibits the excitatory inputs to inhibitory PCs thus revealing CMW and/or bank.<br>
<br>
Memories can be audio songs strung via time eg thot of word desert then "I've been thru the desert on a horse with no name it felt good to be out of the rain in the desert you can remember your name cause they're ain't no one for to give you no name la la la la la la..." I don't think it's like frames of onion skins providing that. I think this form of recall is <br>

Does brain rep spatial relations by creating a tiny bit of temporal element duration in drawing it so that it can segregate each pixel in time and thereby link them together like a jingle?<br>
<br>
Now here's a weird thot but it's almost like your parents as they get older get kicked out and fade from power like everyone's parents and you will too in time just like the current ring. Almost like parent is past ring, you is current, your kid is future ring.<br>
<br>
The attitude of the paper needn't be drawn in a spatial manner but rather automatically by the relationship between SPW and CMW. Also, I think actual world orientation cannot be compared to orientation of perception as orientation of perception is a felt abstract concept of relationships.<br><br>
<br>
Maybe only consciousness has spatial feel and the universe is merely information without space or matter/mass.<br>
<br>
It could be there is no absolute attitude or lock (or position, or speed, or acceleration) of universe but rather only relations between things. What if everything is going in reverse and that is why light speed attaches to what looks like receiver but that is actually emitter because even time is backwards thru lens of observing or consciousness just like all else in brain. Why does massful stuff the throw speed is summation of thrower's amount of force applied to ball plus the forces that gave him his own speed and direction, but massless stuff like light the throw speed attaches to apparent catcher and catcher being zeroed out ("stationary")? Maybe cause having mass the recoil has already happened, but light being massless no recoil in previous steps has been given so light simply propagates at rate of observer (being held stationary).<br>

What if "front view" of self in cerebellum is actually a back view and is repping bank 3d-skin-outline cursor as it rolls SAGGITALLY, and "side views" of body are repping bank 3d-skin-outline cursor 3d ink-head as it rolls horizontally like cinnamon roll CW or CCW? <br>
<br>
Does the cerebellum, in waves, zero your true position back out? Or cartoon 3d skin animation's current position?<br>
<br>
The bank in saggital ball bearing was moving (big circle) CCW if viewing your body from left side; hence, the drag meant the inner bank was rotating CW as viewed from left. After touchdown/matchup/zero-out the "afterburn" raised up and out a bit. And the preceding burn felt like bodyform was being laid down into body from above (maybe a little from below direction). I know that sounds confusing why the preceding burn wasn't only from below but I think it's cause the bank feels like it's getting set in your lap. Honestly I didn't observe preceding burn.<br>

Point of know return video has a little of flow of skins. You could make this just by using a picture, making mostly transparent, and moving. Note that where there is a flow of skins provides a ring - think about it - the intersection of incoming skin with actual skin in SPW (paint) WAIT if you have a flow of skin incoming, then let it leave with its own inertia, since it has a little curve in that, there is a ring IS THERE? Hard to visualize. If there is a ring, it can easily become a trapezoidal puzzle piece taking into account kick out.<br>
<br>
Where cerebrum excites cerebellum, no signal is sent back to cerebrum. Where both || fibers and climbing fibers hit at same time, long term depression of PC (ie long term excitatory signals to cerebrum because inhibitory PC long-term inhibited), long term sending to cerebrum. At inhibition of cerebellum, more generic across the board excitatory signals sent to cerebrum. Weed causes raised output on an across-the-board manner of same cerebellar circuit that normal(sober) outputs for specific select PCs. Does this enable seeing the whole bank rather than just the currently selected skin?<br>
<br>
Could LTD in cerebellum be choices of important skin shapes (and skin motions) to have in bank? Then cerebrum takes that and rotates it? Or maybe cerebellum rotates too.<br>
<br>
Funny thing is, I've seen intersection of skin with SPW get laid down at rates varying from 0.25 - 20 Hz, and maybe faster sober.<br>
<br>
3d spirograph what movement would differring radii have on kickout? Also, what effect would kick out radii from 2d saggital plane have on kick out?<br>
<br>
Smaller radius equals greater kickout || to bed (curve bed) and smoother point at point of transition (where it gets closest to bed). Larger radii (close to maximal) give a sharp point at closest spot and so get there quickly then get away quickly hence not a lot of kickout || to bed (/track).<br>
<br>
It's the same as how a âŠ¥ (horizontal in my case) circle would move if hinged at current point - this determines immediate kickout. Yes it gets more complicated if you kept moving but I think it bases it off instantaneous moments.<br>
<br>
Can call bed/track a 3d stator and the rotating bank a 3d rotor.<br>
<br>
Note also that feet didn't get aligned first; rather whole body aligned at one split second moment. I assume each cycle for the split moment they align is a cycle of "drawing" skin (remember you got 10-20 Hz of skin at chewacla; but only 0.25-0.5 Hz "last night").<br>

"I don't know how to reconcile rings and skins" but "you get skins in both SPW and CMW, and the ring is the thing tethering CMW to SPW." But, in "pure skin world," SPW and CMW do not coexist but rather CMW is temporally interdigitated as (colorless?) paint for one onion skin duration. And the whole CMW can be painted in like 1/50th of a second! <br>
<br>
Why do you "need" ring? Maybe for audio and other inertial feel things? Maybe for providing eye with which to view CMW? Like eye behind that a bit? Why is it "needed" for CMW? Maybe cause for mind's eye? Maybe that's just where it's built into? Does ring provide for "eye" for both SPW and CMW? Is it the "portal" between SPW and CMW? Like those spaces, if expanded, would always overlap each other, so you need a portal to say where the transition will occur? Why does it feel like ring paints everything if you could experience the 3d bank cursor coming and either printing or aligning (felt like printing) skins? Why does bank sometimes rotate and sometimes be still?<br>
<br>
What if the rotating in body skin was proprioception coming in from the body, and it needed to be rotated to match SPW?<br>
<br>
What if color is the knowledge of where a spec is in 3 other dimensions? Or what if it is driven by frequency such that each frequency is its own world? What if color is all memories of same color, linked by same shape.<br>

<br>
It seems there is paint and an observer of paint in brain. Could paint be em signals and observer be receiving antenna whether that be cerebrospinal fluid, skull, or DNA? Or perhaps neurotransmitters and receptors? Or perhaps the hex of neuros is both emitter and receiver?<br>
<br>
Why would meaning of story be seen and known to someone? Unless brain builds up subconsciously an understanding of abstract things also.<br>
<br>
Know that depth (distance, spatial distance) can be done very convincingly on a 2d (depthless) surface by precise paint and real time updating to provide sense of parallax motion, size etc. Presumably, such could be done in 1d (ring) to rep a whole 2d scene. But these objects would have inside meaning for brain like a relative of a relative. <br>
<br>
But what or who are you convincing??<br>
<br>
Is the brain a collapser of wave functions so as to have a tiny bit of control (will) in exchange for a lot less randomness in the local universe? And we collapse it so that we know things' location for a little duration but less so with more time? And it does this by creating a chain of reactions that reduce the possibilities of what the universe could be to a much smaller window? But then why would you feel blue at simulation of hot zone when it wasn't due to blue? So that doesn't make sense.<br>
<br>
As far as consciousness, colored paint, vibrating ring (possibly with patterns to help generate raw feel of qualia of smells etc), and skins (both CMW and SPW) seem to constitute 100% of it. And ring could be drawing the paint and varying how/what it paints where, over time could be the vibration. Could color space be three dimensional counterspatial time? Skins could be drawn by rings (or rings drawn by skins/bank?) via some high-speed rotation mechanism. So how could brain paint color space and transparency (skins/rings)? So in hot zone where consciousness presumably is done, you have glutamate, gaba, and a little serotonin to work with. Maybe a tad of dopamine. And cb1. You have pyramidal neurons, two mesh layers, non-specific modulatory signals (10hz) and regular (?Hz) and resonant connections (40hz) with thalamus, slow connections incoming from PMC (2-4hz). Possibly 0.25-0.5hz signals from somewhere.<br>
<br>
Are reverbs in shaft of dendrite between layers the viewer? <br>
<br>
Basically brain needs to give the feeling of colors and distances.<br>
<br>
Fundamentally, you have charge (e) and mass (n). And charged mass (p) can pass between the worlds. In the world of neurons, you have microtubules (and neural wall) which are mass, ions which are charged mass. Could there be an energy increase in neural wall so that it keeps releasing paint over a duration? Is there a color signature to each neuron's particular AP? Could astrocytes sufficiently alter APs to color them the right color?<br>
<br>
Could brightness to darkness be degree of simulation?<br>
<br>
I bet music amplitude is done by greater displacement of what is painted by rings <br>
<br>
If ring draw is done spin, then moment by moment you only need to feel color (and distance?)?<br>
<br>
Could color somehow be the attitudinal change needed to get it back to straight?<br>
<br>

"Iconic memory" is the (supposedly) 150 ms decay of visual field when you close your eyes. To me it feels more like 50ms or less. Specifically called "visible persistence" to differentiate from "informational persistence" (you know your phone is still there).<br>
<br>
One of these nights - made cartoon of "I can feel her but she's nowhere in sight" and "loneliness will bind you" rather than of band players.<br>
<br>
Is your dress orange or blue? Cause in the mirror it looks blue! I asked Malia she was renting the other half of my bed. I could see her peach skin too (you think). Second or third time to see color in a REM dream! "Im putting on a little mascara" lined up with my position on my bed and basically with mirror altho dream mirror was wider I think. Just like how in emerald tile dream I was lying other direction and that lined up and even hand position and where she had hand on mine, then in blink of moment I open my eyes and she's gone.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
So in dreams, have experienced color (sight) (includes location), sound, touch, smell, and a ton of mood spaces! Don't remember taste but that's essentially smell + location + tactile.<br>
<br>
So, have definitely experienced color with eyes open, and with REM sleep eyes closed. And after image awake eyes closed but that's essentially like having eyes still open cause I think opposing are not fatigued and hence fire relative to the fatigued as if eyes were still open. And hallucinogens allow color when eyes closed! Maybe from this you can put together what neurotransmitter or frequency or region is involved in color.<br>
<br>
So I mean you have "50 Hz," high freq low amplitude, in PHZ, and options for neurotransmitter receptors of cb1 (prolly not cause extra thc doesn't change/induce colors), gaba, glutamate, and serotonin (interesting because hallucinogens target this but serotonin pills alone do nothing to color). <br>
<br>
Dreams:<br>
Not same position (tooty)<br>
Same position same structural elements but different meaning (tent surface vs check surface) and extra person and extra stuff <br>
Same position but different environment (emerald)<br>
Same position same environment but extra person and mood (M___a/S___h peach dress blue in reflection in mirror)<br>
<br>
Dunno that frequency modulation is s good theory of consciousness because the carrier wave is only 0.25-200 Hz. You can't get a ton of detail modulating that right?<br>
<br>
Just entertain this - what if rings are perpendicular to radius of sphere or cinnamon roll as it is touching a particular spot, and don't worry that it takes maybe 2-4 seconds to get back around cause you can "hang on" there while it moves?<br>
<br>
What if the "rebound" from sphere rolling down to side and hitting is equal and opposite and considers the past 0.5 second, so that incoming is curvy in and up (prolly better to describe as down) and out kick is out and curve down? From a sphere in saggital coming from top to away side.<br>
<br>
And that this is what is meant by unfolding of basketballs - you see the incoming of inner ball moving CCW on a "track" but rotating CW (as viewed from left looking towards) before it touches a specific look of radius meeting point, then pass between worlds and begin kicking out from outer shell a new basketball which is moving CW along a track but rotating CCW. Hence the line perpendicular to max differentiation of kickout on ring defines axis of current direction of sphere and max in-come and min out-kick label the forward direction out of the two options. But then how do you account for when in-come is level all across and kick out is level all across? Almost like stationary but I don't think sphere really is stationary.<br>
<br>
The beauty of this idea is, you can first have a ring on a plane, then a 3d concavity and then a thickening and boom you are at onion layers having started at a ring. And maybe what you're looking at on 5/1/22 high is a part of the brain whose contribution to rings is slower frequency (damn you saw desert snaps at 50Hz tho??) but which grows them to these onion rings and paints SPW (or CMW) thereupon? And then another part of the brain uses same ring reference point to make a cavern and vibrates rings to show audio and many other inertial qualial effects?<br>
<br>
In other words, what if all your onion jazz is really just interesting puzzle pieces forming into something bigger of their own - it's just the creation of puzzle pieces and instead of making a cavern it can make actual giant shapes? And in holding the memory of the puzzle pieces it makes interesting shapes. This would be a longer (still short term) memory of up to 30 seconds or longer. But a more basic episodic key points memory - not a remember 10 digits of a phone number memory!<br>
<br>
So getting an onion high - is that due to gravity pulling thc to cerebellum while lying down, or is that due to relaxed (closer to dream) mental state? And are (drawing of) rings then done in superficial most layer of cerebellum? Or still done in PHZ or DMN or in wake-like patterns?<br>
<br>
Cause onion high simply would be hiding the first moments of consciousness; ring high would be showing the near-first moments of consciousness generation and hiding the onion layers. What is sober? Hiding of nearly all of consciousness except the last part or wherever paint and qualia feel are?<br>
<br>
What's also neat is the onion could partially explain point of attitude of ring, and why it is its own attitude separate from SPW and CMW. And the giant onion (need to come up with good name for this!) holds steady to immediate environs. Ring thus kinda does too but has a little movement of its own while onion as a whole is fixed to immediate environs.<br>

Von economo (express 5HT2b, D3, & DISC1 protein)(& fork) neurons in layer 5 of frontoinsula, pACC (pregenual anterior cingulate cortex), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. And communicate with coma-determining part of left pontine tegmentum (near medial parabrachial nucleus). I mean like originate with brainstorm and going up. And that tegmentum being close to raphe and locus coerleus.<br>
<br>
"small region in the rostral dorsolateral pontine tegmentum was significantly associated with coma-causing lesions. In healthy adults, this brainstem site was functionally connected to the ventral anterior insula (AI) and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC). These cortical areas aligned poorly with previously defined resting-state networks, better matching the distribution of von Economo neurons. Finally, connectivity between the Al and pACC was disrupted in patients with disorders of consciousness, and to a greater degree than other brain networks."<br>
<br>
Apparently Von Economo neurons project back (excitatory glutamate) to periaquiductal grey and parabrachial nucleus! They complete that activating loop! Could def see insula/cingulate being location of generation of rings.<br>
<br>
It would make sense for insula to be site of rings because it's right next to jaw speech motor and also auditory cortex! Would cingulate cortex then be site of flow?<br>
<br>
Could neurons be dipole or other, and uses light speed and expansion (inflation) for a very very short duration to inflate the model from ring size to full size? Would said light have to get reabsorbed somewhere to be felt?<br>
<br>
If benzene receptors, then would a main function of release of neurotransmitters be allowing them to add capacitance and soak up some of field? Thing is, DNA has one or two benzenes or some kind of ring.<br>
<br>
It's interesting that paint(to a degree)/ring is glued to immediate environs, but the sensor for said paint is glued to the head(the eye more specifically). Like it doesn't even bother painting (V1) until transforming to previous experience of what it looked like. If it can add then it lets it.<br>

While listening to "Rings" (Selena Gomez), I had a thot. I think that yes rings/sphere can adjust even at fast attitudinal changes to incorporate "real world" into story, but I also think that some of the passing between worlds you see with rings is going from one CMW visualization to another CMW visualization.<br>
<br>

What if universe doesn't have space or time- only perception has the them- and universe has something else, but copacetic to space time info, which solves missing key?<br>

What is stuff that would interfere with conscious cavern wall is inhibited so as not to have misinfo inclusions?<br>
<br>
<br>
Does current loudest freq move around like wave at sea like complex tembre. 4 Hz then you experience a bit of 10 Hz cause it's currently loudest and use this change in loudest focused freq to be focus selector.<br>
<br>
Thot ppls light was jungle scene depicted by song. That's interpreting even visual input to CMW rather than real SPW!! Filler: it's like the concert and hemp was sedating you making it close to sleep where you map input to imagination rather than real world. Kinda like daydreaming.<br>
<br>
Horizontal ring can include downwards to get ppls feet if attention or gaze include there <br>
<br>
Hemp also takes off not only pressure but also the false rush to sex extreme desire it tempers it so as not to freak out girls and hence you no longer look desperate. But desp in another realer way. Like (bad) religion made you so focused on "not desiring" that you end up way more focused on "desiring" when around girls (more than you even WANT to be), so hemp helps you be yourself (only realistically desirous).<br>
<br>
I think hemp takes pressure off via silencing fear scenarios of amygdala.<br>
<br>
Too much social pressure, you (some ppl with traumatic like experiences of that) freeze up and it goes to hell in a handbasket.<br><br>
<br>
"Ring" rate can appear to be skin rate. Skin rate was still too fast to even discern at Dave matthews concert (maybe 50-100+ skins per second or else so smoothed but honestly prolly 50-100+ Hz). Only big angular shifts (say downward) in attention could slightly reveal skins).<br>
<br>
So this morning was thot- CMW and SPW the size and location of linking objects from each reveals plane of page and gives rise to perceptual 3D space?<br>
<br>
My local anesthesia (after dentist cavity fill) chin itches but scratching brings zero relief cause can't feel the scratching on chin.<br>
FILLER: That's actually pretty weird to think about. I know that I am scratching my chin, so it should bring relief, but since signals weren't coming from patch of skin that said "itch," me knowing that I was scratching it didn't change what was painted in the story and the itch continued.<br>
<br>
Most (all?) the qualia feel like something. What feels like something more than inertia? Passing thru frames? Having both a 3d story to depict the qualia and the vibrating ring with changing shape (selection/focus as a general rule) and flow passing thru. Could the more visceral feel of qualia be lower amplitude patterns of vibrations of ring? Such as certain smells. <br>
<br>
But if the fundamental unit of consciousness is the AP (or the EPSP), why aren't all APs conscious, unless they fail to have a proximal built in system of resonance to raise it to a higher level so that only PHZ elicits a conscious hallucination when artifically stimulated?<br>
<br>
What if pyramidal neurons stem is junction in one of at least 3 ways - paper with meanings of both SPW/CMW, ring of focus (of intersection?) of SPW/CMW, or 3DPaint/onionWater? There always seems to be two worlds.<br>
<br>
Maybe layer 5 finally got upper hand for a moment that one time high such that CMW stood stationary and SPW was moved around like a spider(?).<br>
<br>
Good point: could be that activating system isn't any component of consciousness nor the rings but rather only helps regulate amplitude of consciousness.<br>
<br>
It seems you can see (experience) more than one color at once, even if you can only focus on one at a time.<br>
<br>
<br>Maybe mind's eye looks from center out to cave wave to see CMW painted there (and Brad's eye is at an angle looking at SPW), but none of this is the angle of the paper that draws the paint.<br>
<br>
The ID of what things are is largely unconscious (well, let's say it like this: the abstract ID that seems to exist for every concept, item, object, commonality, etc. IS ABSTRACT, but you KNOW when you've tapped into one of these tags cause there's a moment of "got it!" even prior to taking that tag and finding the associational word for the item). The imagined audio of "cat" or imagining jaws moving to say "cat" or imagining the written word "cat" would be conscious, but the first underlying id seems unconscious (better, ABSTRACT), because there's no way to rep (consciousify; no, put into words) a perfectly abstract id. Filler: ineffable or not puttable into words; but not unconscious necessarily.<br>
<br>
The only things that are part of consciousness are 3D painted world (includes color), 3D imagination world (and the abstract things depicted therein [usually only outlines]), and vibratory rings (plus flow) more or less bringing focus or "foveal view" of mind's eye. <br>
<br>
So consciousness is essentially visual/spatial/inertial in quality.<br>
<br>
Perhaps when eyes of two people meet, the axis of physical eye and mind's eye come essentially entirely together and hence drop down close.<br>
<br>
Look at this trilobite eye. If it was one of the first, might the eye have been behind development of consciousness in the first place, and as a marriage of two eyes (two sides of paper but both SPW; and humans [apes?] evolved past others via folding on self and creation of a CMW for "abstract" thought?)? Or perhaps other animals with folded neocortex have a CMW, but not so well developed as humans with their large PFC? The trilobite set up looks like mind's eye in center looking outwards at ring of cavern wall!<br>
<br>
If freq determines amplitude of a pure sine wave, what determines loudness?<br>
<br>
- [ ] In dream this time, no knowledge of where/position of my real body lying on side facing window. In dream I was standing facing closet doors. Trying to find fossilized clam for grandma birthday gift. Could find other flash irridescent stone that I wanted to keep cause two outlines made wavy rings. Give J___ C_______ white flowers out of back of Volvo. Was doing insulation or panels at kinda attic space of fpc?<br>
<br>
How does brain generate scene plus seer? Is it time lag between firing and allowing to affect? You know what kind of looks like scenes? The concave curvature of synapse/post synaptic. This would comport with seeing less while high and seeing more of rings. Is it difference between radiation of charge from end of neuron arriving first then physical molecules coming?? Or let radiation go further, then "read" distance to that when molecules arrive to post synaptic? Or could AP end radiation bubble be viewer and reverberations of EPSPs in dendrites be painting scene? If so, could EPSPs be white and IPSPs be black? Could viewer be dna inside the post synaptic soma? Could two tiers of branches of dendrites of pyramidal be two scenes getting split apart? Could viewer be cerebrospinal fluid in ventricles? Or, could viewer simply be created ipso facto by direction of gaze of character?<br>

IV. The Ring's Relation to Vantages, Vectors, and Locks<br>
1. Ring Attitude (Relative to SPW), Locked (Specific) Spin (Can Change Attitude or Spin); 1Â° Removed from Reference (Seemingly); the ACTUAL Stationary Reference of All. The starting point of all.<br>
2. SPW (Local Environs), with AGU, Certain Rotation; the SEEMING Stationary Reference of All <br>
3. CMW (Local Environs), with AGU, Certain Rotation; 1Â° Removed from Reference (But interplay between CMW and RING is planned!!)(Like ring moves vantage origin and spin quickly through CMW while CMW can 3d rotate on its own slowly)(In fact it may be ring which is stationary and fixed and referential, hence SPW may be spinning through it like a mfer with CMW spinning thru it in a more tame manner)(maybe SPW spins like a mfer all the time but the result is that it looks stable and detached from the rings)(I think maybe so but I think color [paint] must be a sort of fine (fast, low amp) vibration of ring)(Just remember, the brain doesn't just give consciousness of YOU - it gives you consciousness of the environs and of other people - only reasonable it would thus be centered in front of you!!)(the ring only has position and attitude because it must relative to SPW).<br>
4. SPW Vantage Origin and Vector (1Â° Removed from Reference, but Can Drag)/CMW Vantage Origin (1Â° Removed) and Vector (2Â° Removed)/Attention or Episodic Memory Vantage and Origin <br>
5. SPW of Environs Outside a Vehicle, Etc. Can Apply to CMW.<br>
6. SPW Position/Orientation of Self Objects Including Head, BODY (Tethered to Local Environs). Can Apply to CMW.<br>
7. SPW Position/Orientation/Movement of Other Objects (Cars Not Driven By You Etc). Can Apply to CMW.<br>
<br>
It's like ring is tethered for fine movements to immediate environs (staying locked both positionally and 3d rotationally), but will update to stay tethered positionally to body with sufficient distance movement of body. So that fine movements of body don't affect ring, but large movements slowly drag it updating it. But fine movements of a car do affect ring, as do large movements. The ring doesn't want the body to bounce consciousness all over when doing jumping jacks, but it allows it in a car on a bumpy road. <br>

You cannot have a view without having a viewer. It's meaningless and useless without the viewer. Why must it be this way? Is the viewer a point? If so how can a point see all that area? Where does the fact you can change distance to desired focal plane with one eye via lens come in? I think certain squeezes correspond to focusing (each pixel to a pinpoint) (best resolution) planes at varying distances (1', 20') given the distance to retina in eyeball (1"?). Your view is really only 2D. You have no 3d info, not in the paint sense. You only have 2d info of paint. Further, you don't have 3d skins with paint applied all coming from say west wind- you have paint applied coming from viewer outwards in a conic application. This conic angle is 90Â° for an eye. Your finger going from eye outwards traces path to object out there regardless of where you rotate eye in socket. Does it somehow project it back out thru lens? Is that why it feels high like viewer is big conic shell and observation is a point or the small circle of lens?<br>
<br>
Dream: Popo- (He had taken me on a ride.) maybe you should tell your mom that you don't like it (like what?) like being attracted to someone like that (oh well I think she has the right to break up with me if she doesn't like the chemistry mentally between us). Start waking up, that ramping up, I think my brain was replaying what it learned about me shifting quickly between left eye right eye lR lR lR rL rL rL the day before and perhaps in my sleep that night. But I thot REM sleep looked like awake or does it transition thru reg sleep for a moment? So this could have been nonREM and still dream with simple dream then awake so yes you prolly were experiencing that ramp up.<br>
<br>
"Brainstem circuits induce waking" then brainstem circuits may be responsible for forcing inputs to be tied to reality rather than imagination. Perhaps it's the speed (high freq) that triggers this linkage, and perhaps outside sounds help to keep it there. Sounds are pretty much the only thing that externally awake you right? No wonder they come thru brainstem?<br>
<br>
When you tell someone what you dreamed, you tell them where you wandered your mind (where you "day (but night) dreamed" to).<br>
<br>
You don't have time (you&others don't allow yourself to) to process or explore feelings or emotion during day because next split moment you're supposed to be on to the next thing, and brain rushes you forward (more than when you're a child?) possibly by muscle memory of learned brain patterns.<br>
<br>
Dreams can happen in nonREM, but simple ideas usually not full blown Dr strange flying movie. This comports.<br>
<br>
You seem to have less will when awake because you are jostled to next thing and have only 1/50th of a second to steer stuff. Dreams you have 1/4th of a second to steer stuff (?).<br>
<br>
<br>
Will exists just as much as animal free movement exists - pfc controls how animal moves (or how it moves thru story) via filters. "You" don't like something, you can change.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Beings of atoms can learn to live with atoms in a way that does not take from the beauty being built by other beings of atoms.<br>
<br>
What if - PHZ handles paint or SPW structure, and anterior insula (and/and not dorsal anterior cingulate) handles rings (and/and not story?). Then ARAS really would just be levels. What if rings help provide 3d sense to already created flat paint maps by mapping funky orientations/sizes to insula to paint on rings? Then it would make sense why local environs appears stable and yet sometimes you see world spinning like a mfer and why when PHZ is particularly suppressed you see rings as the  reference (but still at an attitude).<br>
<br>
Dreams I think we can say conclusively involve PHZ paint acting to produce imaginative story, apparently without PFC!<br>
<br>
But they say for nonREM dreams, spindles decrease in amplitude and rise in freq and spindles increase greatly in amplitude in PFC. So PFC is left out of it, but posterior allowed a bit of play.<br>
<br>

The ascending arousal system largely originates from a series of well-defined cell groups with identified neurotransmitters. This pathway has two major branches. The first branch (yellow in Figure 10.6) is an ascending pathway to the thalamus that activates the thalamic relay neurons that are crucial for transmission of information to the cerebral cortex. The major source of upper brainstem input to the thalamic-relay nuclei, as well as to the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, is a pair of acetylcholine-producing cell groups: the pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei (PPT/LDT). The neurons in the PPT/LDT fire most rapidly during wakefulness and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, which is the stage accompanied by cortical activation, loss of muscle tone in the body and active dreams. These cells are much less active during non-REM sleep, when cortical activity is slow. Their input to the reticular nucleus is crucial, as it sits between the thalamic-relay nuclei and the cerebral cortex, acting as a gating mechanism. However, recent experiments suggest that in rats the reticulo-thalamo-cortical pathway may play a very limited role in behavioral or electrocortical arousal, whereas the projection from the (medial not lateral) parabrachial nucleus and precoeruleus region, relayed by the basal forebrain to the cerebral cortex, may be critical for this process.45<br>
<br>
A second pathway (red) activates the<br>
cerebral cortex to facilitate the processing of inputs from the thalamus. This arises from neurons in the monoaminergic cell groups, including the tuberomammillary nucleus (MN) containing histamine (His), the A10 cell group containing dopamine (DA), the dorsal and median raphe nuclei containing serotonin (5-HT), and the locus coeruleus (LC) containing noradrenaline (NA). This pathway also receives contributions from peptidergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (LHA) containing orexin (ORX) or melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), and from basal forebrain (BF) neurons that contain GABA or ACh. Note that all of these ascending pathways traverse the region at the junction of the brainstem and forebrain where von Economo noted that lesions caused profound sleepiness.<br>

I could see the scene being completely flat and meaning of 3d could still arise. But. As you get closer to the stop light red light it never jumps in discrete sizes nothing ever jumps into discreet sizes is that just the resolution of the neuron speaking or does that mean that there is no retinotopic birthing of the scene. And there seems to be no such perfect retinotopic map.<br>
<br>
Flip flop flip flop (where people think they are in relation to each other is twice removed from reality)- does brain use this to create the distance in scene? Prolly not.<br>
<br>
What if cerebellum body image is 2D but like a photo uses sizes to create a sense of 3D therefrom, but with rolling ball tricks. And creates the body skin that comes. Why slow when high? Cause it's inhibiting the incoming excitatory signals so that much fewer happen.<br>
<br>
Could layer 2,3 be mapped to 3d and layer 5 to 2d and the relative amounts of 2d or 3d create colors?<br>
<br>
Yes you can read stuff that tests mice - any means possible that does not hurt and that may one day save them from testing.<br>
<br>
Does it depress it cause cerebrum already got that info and wants whatever new stuff can be added?<br>
<br>
Cerebellum - LTP means you have these ghost shells that result in lower than normal firing of DCN (deep cerebellar nuclei). LTD means that DCN is gonna hold steady in its firing regardless of incoming stuff. Kind of like how eye first layer (cones) fires constantly, but there's a decrease when light comes in. Is even this reversed????? Like is light actually repped as a decrement? But remember it gets flipped at next layer. Anywho. So it's like the only informational output from cerebellum (unless something stored in freq info) is these ghost shells of decrease from normal firing. Is this a skin or is this the provider of inertial feel of a "surprise you thot I was gonna fire at this rate but actually im firing at this slower rate!" The whole cerebellum firing its DCN neurons at normal rate all the time apparently is not useful info to the cerebrum (unless it provides a spatial scaffold but remember those without cerebellum apparently still have space)- but alas, these decrements are. Wait. LTP of PCs (via simultaneous PFs but not CFs) means it's more available for use as a ghost shell (decreased output of those DCNs is more easily achievable via PF stimulation from cerebrum or body). Does LTD simply help define said shells like on-center off-center stuff?????<br>

2/28/22 Talked about Feb 11(?) and may 1 notes at chewacla yesterday. Felt good cause ginseng and schi. Also took dog on walk and went to niffers and mason's jar.<br>
<br>
2/29/22 took 1/2 of remaining 1/6th of gummies in morning, then Smith Mountain Fire Tower trail back side.<br>
<br>
Von economo - always right or always left feel? Or dielectric shoot tesla thing? Or sets up compressions and rarefactions to sides? Are these read by difference between upper and lower tiers of pyramidal neurons? Of yea diff size diameter of dendrites or whole corkscrew would then change frequency.<br>
<br>
Girls spend a lot of time reading you and making sure you can't tell -they're reading if you're desperate by looking. <br>
<br>
Don't go nuts (regretting not n____). Its your birthright to find that upliftingly funny. This approach is good. Can always find some.<br>
<br>
The evolutionarily advantage of consciousness is that drawing a 3d picture story to rep bad scenarios is less intensive requirement of food and processing than otherwise. You are an automaton. Consciousness is an efficiency mechanism it's used.<br>
<br>
3d Paint is independent of the story. Story can come in as body skin and walk along. Bank is printer of skins it is a turning screw. Like a bubble you can get 2d which inflates to 3d bubbles puzzle pieces. Before the (2d intersecting with) screw gets to is future and kickout behind is the past <br>
<br>
As walking up this trail, pole of screw is headcrown up and to left tilt. See pic. But plane thru it was more AGU coronal (thus diagonal thru screw), and turning round it could rep left elbow, feet, right elbow, head. 3:35<br>
<br>
See vid- as I walk along, now pole of screw forwards-backwards axis, ring/frame is 2d coronal plane - string is ahead in forward direction, kite is hung, screw TURNING SLOWLY pushes current frame to paster position and pulls future to current. Tension in pull is the resistance felt trying to go forward (the "air/wind" holding the kite back from making progress, but this is also what keeps the kite aflight [and maybe the ring aflight]).<br>
<br>
It's drawing out a shape (that stays with the ground from grounds perspective) as you walk. The outlines skins become rings(selections of outlines skins) by the NET FORWARD instantaneous MOVEMENT DIRECTION of whole body skin - if ground part of skin isn't contributing to net direction then it isn't making up lots of the ring. Filler; I think even point tracer of ring <br>
<br>
Only paying attention to the inertials of a single plane at a single time when walking.<br>
<br>
Both stories going at same time you get lost in imagination, you only decrease control by 50% cause that world is still going just not focus. Look to either or by the rings which can be skins. It's the birthplace of the two worlds going outward one left one right from say a sagittal plane ring.<br>
<br>
As you lift gaze, pole of screw lifts forward more slowly and less so. As I turn on trail, pole faces forward direction so turns but Lagingly laggingly. That makes coronal pinwheel of trapezoids from coronal plane intersection with screw. And radius arm thus is turning one 360Â° (one thread) turn per step. But also whole 4-5' diameter ring traces for bubble of kickoff.<br>
<br>
Omg the paint? Jeez that's tough lemme see.<br>
<br>
It doesn't trace the whole body outline (CMW)- it traces a rotating 2d intersection ring with the skins over time to create 3d. So that fire together wire together is drawing the the diagonal curve of-skin as it moves thru TIME (the kite pull back). So for a hiker you should be rotating around an outline of him at some intersection <br>
This is the left ear back head right ear forehead thing at hotel. Traces a ring. This time left elbow, feet, right elbow, head. It's you, in motion, oveuru uryuyrgi over time. That's why it can easily add dung.<br>
Look down as walking feel most resistance, look forward plane must shift from coronal to horizontal, and can't apply any air (movement in physical world) to it to create sense of Inertia.<br>
Ring can rep a father distance radius (any distance radius 0+ imp) by what is there (since you already have learned to associate certain distances with certain sizes for objects). Sizes of things chosen determines it <br>
The slowest ring shows what to draw 3d story within as it moves thru time and this slowest ring alone traces out cavern wall EQUALS ring -!at the right intersection!- equals bubbles equals trapezoids equals kick out Tracer of ring can move pretty fast - really as fast as you'd want to move attention (3d cursor like pin point in 3d space). If you stand still, imagination world must begin to move (wind blow) in a certain direction so that net ring cursor draws still an outline in motion. Draw attention to world have to kick world out some direction maybe down. Flow has to change hands. Wherever is drawing this thing (another place is possibly painting the color paint scene) is thus by definition handling flow (+ ring = skins or puzzle pieces). The attention point point has to move thru the ring and get perpendicular to it upon in-come - to get to CMW from SPW. The flow helps draw the onion skin equals piluzzle piece equals trapezoid. This inside of ring (at this point in generation of consciousness) is portal between for attention point it's the flat sheet of paper thing that yes changes attitude. Maybe that's why it felt minds eye at center - really attention point can move anywhere but upon first crossing to CMW, it would be at center looking out in some way. I think everything (every vantage) is really looking from a single point behind your head forwards towards wherever attention point cursor is. But then I guess not always cause that sudden jump 16" down of view? Or is there a view of all of that which is what I'm talking about? Like SPW (eye's view), CMW (mind's view), and then view of both together?<br>
<br>
Sound (popular) is movement thru frames flow from front to back coronal ring this drawing a corkscrew on Wall floor wall ceiling of cave as walking in thru it. The 2d intersections with sensory physical world coronal at same time is same physical corkscrew (sonicified a little) (can do sonic a lot if brain wants to) which is tracing movement of CMW. And of course you can create a gear to pull and read two film paints or meanings off one key rib pattern). It's like a dna thru the air. The reason you see a freq of same neuron firing is cause ring tracer keeps coming back to that spot that often. Finer vibrations (40 Hz) just draw finger edge detail where you want to draw 2d plus time for third. <br>
This painting of color (?) is also that thing you see with square plus triangle on side like in bath.<br>
The ring is like sonic in how it whizzes around you like a daredevil!. 1/2heartbeats up to 4-10/heartbeat - always just one immediate frequency (Filler: just one instantaneous velocity of ring tracer at any time [altho there may be other higher freq rings]. But velocity of tracer varies like a mfer!)<br>
About 1/footstep.<br>
Faster rings could still be drawn within confines of cavern wallsmove-thru. All theyd have to define is radius out within their cycle by number neurons precession and at spicifically when.<br>
Filler: what if EPSPs (or IPSPs) are like plucking a guitar string, and each dendrite system of one neuron has its own unique natural frequency and harmonics. <br>
Axis of eye gaze is always going to intersection <br>
Head and attention direction point connector is always intersecting ring :<br>
<br>
But you know maybe not always or maybe giant horizontalish ring is always intersecting, but small ring is okay to be coronal of screw pass.<br>
<br>
What if inhibition slows the tracer and excitation speeds it up? What if speed diffs bw APs encodes something?<br>
If what it was drawing were moving it would draw this cavern with meaning of CMW and SPW attached to its 2 space-plus-1-time-D corkscrew. <br>
Something else helps give the balloon "mind's eye or cavern eye out radial look " paint. The minds eye looks at the paint of the world too time to time.<br>
Force sent to muscles vs spatial distance movement achieved equals inertial feel. There's a feel of how much force sent and a feel of the difference actually moved in story or SPW measuring feel of the resistance. Water resists more than moving without water. And dragging toe thru sand resists more. <br>

Fast pace changes in radius length can draw fine details of sightstructure or of sound but 50 Hz of VC may be just ring rate. Or even just rate of drawing one area of space that keeps coming around. What is done at certain precessions of certain paster or current or futurer rings may contain mechaism of how paint (color) is drawn.<br>
Filler: does coil of corkscrew neurons lock and some multiplier effect there? Or some inductance induced to create wiggle with some capacitance thing (synapses?)?<br>
Maybe slight precession rates 0Â°-5Â° draw up and below ring to give square plus triangle. Something has to give radius (what[size objects] is painted), something has to give paint itself. Maybe von economo??<br>
Precession of 0-5Â° of the 0.25-4hz cycle in the Vc (or PHZ) painting the scene. It's like it keeps old paint for filling in periphery vs joins them together and updates what stuff needs maybe pibolar von economo provide whether up vs down of triangle updated.<br>
Driving you can push the corkscrew to hold radius arm at one 0-360Â° angle as you race down shaft at sign with word you are focusing on hence making a vertical sagittal wall parts of which that is wiggled to left and right to help you see word. Or a saggital left-horizontal plane and you look over from eye to that wall on your right <br>
Remember ring can intersect thru air - it needn't trace a perfect body skin intersection path but must rather paint (wall hight is perpendicular to both ring forward direction of tracer and view vantage axis of viewer; wall pitch is perpendicular[or close?] to radius ie minds eye or cavern eye out whatever and to ring tracer forward along ring path direction) appropriately.<br>
It must be that brain thinks eyes are cocked off vertical when sideways, even tho they are vertical. For flag trick.<br>
Wait - it's not precessing in time, it's precessing in along-ring-direction position of what's painted to help give it distinction(?) or to help paint details? And of course in position up or down. Unfolding of basketballs one inward to nothing and one outward and larger. <br>
The cycles of compression in cycles is somewhat incidental as scene only takes like 1/3 to 1/2 of cycle. When scene ain't painting is when inertia body movements are (?) so look for sensorymotor to be out of sync with visual WHEN HORIZONTAL RINGS, and 100% (not half or quarter cycle) sensorymotor going while coronal rings walking up steep hill. Ring is horizontal right now around phone 1' diameter or less. Stripping is vertical. Don't know how 45Â° to left  45Â° pitch down "coronal" plane of phone is painted.<br>
Flow is created by what is painted over time. 2spacedPlus1timeD.<br>

General pallidus excitation could be degree of excitement to do a thing. Or could be steering the ball. Cerebellum a precision 3d skin alignment ghost thing. Then what else major - corpus callosum cables joining left to right. The cables to and from cerebellum. That leaves just the cables to and from thalami for organization of the whole cortex into 2 stories via one 2d ring plus physical movement during time. Well, and insula and cingulate. And hippocampus must do something.<br>
<br>
I need to be a (eye contact) more confidant person, and more funny lighthearted joking so as to make enjoyable. If you look away right after looking at a girl of course it signals you are scared or don't want to interact.

Dreams tonight included going to sbc__- bobs was still there - look out window see grass with hundreds of blades all defined and GREEN, then "opened eyes" in dream and was in different room completely ("provin I could imagine (really just dream) in color"), so I "closed my eyes" to return. Except I'm not sure I actually opened my eyes and awoke. Anywho. Another dream was walking thru a cave and had words caps on wall you could punch in and they lighted up for a bit and some flashes. Snake almost bit me and I had him behind the head and was about to throw him back and saw there were all his buddies about to come bite me too so I threw him off and woke up to escape before he could come bite me! And I really did wake up here. There weren't as many clothes in the closet when changing at ssndhill since families like the r__ had left. But prolly 200 people so replacement folks had come. Someone had spread all my brain papers over a table and I was like what are you doing that for lemme gather them back up. Also decided to take my laser with me since why store it there when I never came there.<br>
<br>
Shape of ring has to be informed by content of CMW (and SPW body at least), hence is done by what sizes are painted and hence shape is NOT needed by ARAS. But, there may still be a pattern for lotsa ring shapes because you can print paint on air behind ring so I don't think ring shape itself is being completely done at CMW/SPW's command, tho obviously what ring to use when must consider that stuff and get close.<br>
<br>
There are outputs of basal ganglia that go to brainstem (!!!!!!!).<br>
<br>
There are a lot of processing streams thru basal ganglia -look at all!! Way more than just 4.<br>
<br>
The basal ganglia are NUCLEI they were gonna be cerebral cortex but didn't migrate but rather stayed close to ventricles! Not a layered cortex but a group NUCLEI.<br>
<br>
There are parallel processing streams that are concerned with the "initiation and suppression"(wait for proper timing placement? Or just a levels thing?) of movement in domain of physical action, mental action, or emotional action.<br>
<br>
VA/VL of thalamus is "motor thalamus"<br>
<br>
I think honestly basal ganglia is more like has foot on brake as default for several different cerebral cortex neurons (with car wanting to go down hill), and you can with dopamine and right signals previously take foot off brake to allow cortex motor (or emotional-"motor" or mental/eyeField-"motor") to fire instantiate  movement. Maybe can also take foot off brake to instantiate stopping of movement with an inhibitory style instruction.<br>
<br>
With dopamine present, signals from cerebrum will get thru basal ganglia immediately (or in quicker speed do the sequence?); without sufficient dopamine, will be too sticky. So this may not be the ring, but may be the start and stop movement you notice (inertial changes).<br>
<br>
Why a lot of weed causes Parkinson movement in healthy people but a little weed relaxes Parkinson sufferers movements to more fluid - maybe subthalamic nuclei afflicts Parkinson and gets inhibited it's axons going to globus pallidus internal. But too a healthy person, too much weed means even the striatum's inhibition of globus pallidus internal is inhibited and hence you get jerky movements like Parkinsons. The jerky movements is what reveals the ring tho. I suspect Parkinsons may be able to see rings.<br>
<br>
Hypokinetic sufferers.<br>
<br>
I suppose it could brake or not brake initiation of self expression too (nucleus accumbens part?) or brake or not brake changing of eye or mind's eye (caudate); not only braking or not braking allowance or timing of initiation of body movement (putamen).<br>
<br>
Pinpoint Cursor on 3d world or 3d imagination.<br>
<br>
Could basal ganglia be more SELECTION of alternate choices if "gut feel" is inhibited? As such, is it the will? And I guess all three go at once (you're still able to walk even when lost in imagination), even tho absolute focal attention can be whatever "you" want.<br>
<br>
Maybe cb1 agonism alone (in Parkinsons sufferers) increases cAMP, but it is a fact that cb1 and D1/D2 together both decrease movement/cAMP. As per below article. cAMP actually decreases with combined activation of cb1 and D1, but this still results in net less movement.<br>
<br>
<br>
CB1 may increase action of substantia nigra pars compacta. Per this article.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Dopamine neurons don't have cb1 receptors. But glutamate and gaba neurons do.<br>
<br>
Cerebellum could generate skin by what is highlighted at a precise moment in a front a back and two side 2D images and two top bottom (vermis?) images of the same thing.<br>
<br>
Saccule sensitive to pitching of head (and staticly held pitched angles). Also, accelerating in an elevator.<br>
Utricle mostly roll head or sideways left right translation.<br>
Otolith, like eye and maybe cerebellum, has both on-center polarization, and off-center hyperpolarization!<br>
Otolith- 40hz tonic all the time; up to 100 Hz when tilted; down to 20hz when hyperpolarized.<br>
Semi-circular canal - fires at 80 Hz, acceleration or deceleration of rotation will polarize (120 Hz peak then going back down) or hyperpolarize (50 Hz min then going back up) accordingly.<br>
Otolith give rise to constant (sustained) response; Semi-circular give rise to CHANGE phasic response. This is also like pressure sensors where one fires upon CHANGES, and another fires in a sustained manner as long as being pressed.<br>
Two horizontal "matched" but right superior goes with left inferior and left superior goes with right inferior.<br>
Two horizontal will give accelerating/decelerating changes of yaw turns but has NOTHING to show yaw current position (except you do have view).<br>
Pitch down activates superior canals; pitch up and back activates inferior canals.<br>
Left yaw turn would increase activity in left horizontal canal. Right yaw turn would increase activity in right horizontal canal.<br>
Honestly, otolith handle static angles and linear acceleration altho rotational accelerations would trigger also (SUSTAINED signal  [as long as force there]); Semi-circular canals show rotational accelerations (TRANSIENT signal).<br>
<br>
Vestibulo-ocular reflex - horizontal left semi-circular canal activated when head turns left. If want to keep gaze steady, there's a reflex action to move eyes to right to stay on object. No brain needed - pure reflex. Only brain needed is if you don't want to maintain gaze on that object but are combining head rotation with gaze shift. So there is that one if/then pass, but otherwise it is a REFLEX reaction.<br>
<br>
VOR - vestibulo ocular reflex <br>
<br>
Deep cerebellar nuclei for vestibular flocculo nodulo of cerebellum? The vestibular nuclei!!!!! In brainstem!<br>
<br>
Actually, inferior olive climbing fiber Ltd may be saving of a specific shell, because remember deep nuclei compare straight mossy/climbing to what inhibition comes back from PCs. <br>
<br>
So what if the only thing you are conscious of (the only things which have an effect upon you) are forces? Is there a way to do force like wire electricity transfer via woo woo? Or do body shifts provide (via ACTUAL inertial incoming forces) ring upon which scene hung and scene can then have 3d meaning? But what about when asleep and body not really moving much?<br>
<br>
Vibrating neurons something with propagation of signal faster than mechanical vibrations? Electromagnetic propagates at light speed; electrical propagates at what 50 m/s?; mechanical vibrating of neuron maybe a frequency pretty high but not much displacement.<br>
<br>
It kinda seems like the brain is too big for there to be any meaning to the where something is firing, and it also seems hopeless that such comparatively (to tiny scale and huge area) far distances would mean anything to each other and unite.<br>
<br>
Many things vibrate your body - your brain sends muscle commands to induce a sway and smaller vibrations. Your breathing in and out moves chest and body. Your heartbeat induces vibrations in your body. Heartbeat in brain induces vibrations of neurons. <br>
<br>
With eyes closed imagination, you can get close to the feeling of seeing a color or smelling something, and can imagine sounds quite well. I think you either lack the sufficiently high frequency or the resonance (or high freq resonance). It's not a matter of connectivity cause same connectivity is there with eyes closed. But with eyes closed, you lose 40 Hz Vc. Also, I think you still have 40 Hz resonant, so that must not be color (?).<br>
<br>
Tiny jerks in body movement are often frames.<br>
<br>
Where your eyes (fronts thereof but maybe retinas thereof) physically are is where vantage of physical eye is and that vector. Even your eyes are wiggled back and forth in microsaccades. <br><br>

K_ from dating app had begun going to E__'s religious meet groups. Every one of these sentences needs to be slowed down and appreciated the mood to about 1:4th the speed or even less (based on gap duration diff between 4hz and 50hz?).<br>
<br>
Locations for rings or ring components (?): insula(/cingulate), basal ganglia (/parts of thalamus/then parts of cortex), brainstem, superior colliculi. Color could be connectivity because close your eyes and connected occipital part of PHZ goes silent (?). Maybe skins come from somatosensory to cerebellum but get spun around and alignment is the climbing fiber fire which induces LTD for 30 minutes and this knowledge of where your body was is thus saved long enough in cerebellum or else something else (deep cerebellar nuclei inhibited at pin point then higher firing for 30 minutes) like cortex or hippocampus can make a frame therefrom. What is this, a precise alignment pairing (and mechanism to "hold in memory" 30 minutes) of somatosensory skin with paint (coming from dorsal [location info] and ventral [color/object info] visual streams)? Then cortex remains the bank (somatosensory is region of body skins; dorsal visual stream is region of object/face skins; ventral visual stream is region of whole retinal scene skin; pfc might have a ton of other object skins). What region has to do with impressing sound vibrations on ring - insula (/cingulate)? Perhaps the right pfc does this as it seems to create the 3d story supporting the music, and perhaps it contributes faster rings, and this kinda makes sense as right pfc fingered as site of creation of rhythm and timing and meter. Or maybe that region handles determination of timing but insula actually draws the vibrations.<br>

What do you need mechanisms for?<br>
1. Paint (includes color and 3d location [seems to force a viewer direction]) - includes Flow (movement, both for SPW, CMW) (done by changing what is currently painted shifts world to be blown?).<br>
2. Cursor (and Vibration thereof).<br>
FILLER: HAHA, now I think I know better. What do I need? ONLY the ever loving cursor!! I.e., its spatial location within perception. Axial/radial zigs/zags appear sufficient to encode meaning for color and sound. "Flow" is just the leftover firings and how they must be kicked for present to make sense.<br>
<br>
<br>
Wait. Why could you see ring slowly drawn this time?<br>
<br>
Stated another way, what do you need mechanisms for?<br>
1. Paint <br>
2. Flow <br>
3. Ring (multiple freq at once?)<br>
4. Vibrations <br>
5. Skins <br>
<br>
FILLER: Okay, to get nit picky, you MIGHT need not just the instantaneous 3D cursor location in perceptual space (to create consciousness), but a multitude of points to paint by 3D skins when in that rare mode. But it's all about locations (within perceptual space).<br>
<br>
So some of these you have correlate areas that you think, and even the basic means, but not exquisite specificity of the mechanism. Certainly not anything that feels very copacetic. What mechanism would feel like seeing? What mechanism would feel like inertia?(Movement Thru). What would feel like movement? Time spent in batch APs?<br>
<br>
Could APs be flow? And PSPs be something?<br>
FILLER: NO, I think APs coming from cortex and going to thalamus and body muscles is the cursor, and the PFC that is reading it knows where the intended place within perception is.<br>
<br>
The structure of the pyramidal neuron is interesting - like a table or barrel of electrical wire. Does this set up allow capacitance variation between layers 2,3 and 5?<br>

Whoa. What if cursor puts out a sphere of paint from that location? And the bubble congeals along path of ring trace? And can be boxified? But must be able to change paint in real time after being emitted so as to have video.<br>
<br>
What if real-time input from eyes is considered so as to update paint on surface, but ring's even more so updating pass comes thru much less frequently?<br>

What if dance of ring brings an observer in?<br>

What if bank is a world of its own, every bit as needful as CMW, SPW(/memories). What if ring can do a complex frequency and can hence sort of be multiple frequencies at once?<br>
<br>
Could the rings/spheres be drawing of attention to discrepancies between matching of CMW and SPW only present when high? And when sober, visual component of CMW is erased leaving only the feeling?<br>
<br>
What if color and all qualia and consciousness itself are generated via rings in brainstem nuclei? And pyramidal neurons never had anything to do with it?<br>
<br>
Could superior colliculi be site of color/paint?<br>
<br>
I bet brain stores inertia (weight) and angular momentum (angular inertia?) of objects. Dream. More specifically, the resistance to linear translational accelerations (same all directions except gravity) and resistance to specific rotational accelerations in 3 axes. And this inertia value increases in media like water as opposed to air, and more gravity on bigger planet, and less gravity in space or free fall. Why does this sound like the inductor of an LC circuit. Is there also a capacitive provider of the sudden release of energy to power such an acceleration? I guess ATP. <br>
<br>
Prolly this inertia and rotational inertia etc shown via bowling ball but calculated beforehand? What is painted shows where ring is and is ring in unanticipated place then shows inertia.<br>

<br>
You can imagine "and it sounds very similar" as imaginary-speaking it (slightly engages muscles that would actually result in talk) or imaginary-hearing it (no noticable engagement of muscles). Might be different cartoon. Either way, apparently the complex vibrational sound wave info pulse happening electromagnetically. That is, brain can generate it from scratch, and no wonder cause it predicts stuff all the time. And when it predicts correctly, the sound adds less net increase in brain activity, but when it's a surprise, it adds full amount from input! Abstract thot is generating this stuff (and images) and moving around in that realm, exploring.<br>
<br>
Might it do the same with light? <br>
<br>
Why can't brain (usually) generate color from scratch just thinking (tho it can do 3d and skin outlines)? Is it too high of a frequency? Does brain use only a slightly higher (than sound) vibration for color?<br>
<br>
Maybe the reason you can look at the bank is cause you can also look at the rings or spheres - the center from which brain starts to draw is a little IN FRONT OF YOU.!!<br>

<br>
What if just the fact that collaterals have to pass thru sup olive introduces lag for vibration? Doubt it as it would be only one phase duration lag ("freq"), not all as needed (?) (unless like radio it can use that specialized lag).<br>
<br>
Until someone has found something that makes sense, you can't really have confidence that you have found the mechanism of consciousness. Once you find something that starts leading to lots of being able to explain things, then you can get excited.<br>
<br>
Could physical space be degree of present-moment time concurrency? And be strictly relational, but physical? Closer objects have greater present time concurrency - less time lag to learn their actions. Could physical movement then be actually time movement, and relative changes between all relative things builds a 3d axis basis? Could every movement vector and speed have its own medium for light? Distance is present (or specific) time lag, which can only be overcome or increased gradually by considering relative movements to each other and adding enough acceleration to have a net motion towards. Once you get close, must decelerate or you'll blow past.<br>
<br>
It would seem that visual paint needs refresh rate pretty high maybe 80Hz or even just staggered at 24-40Hz prolly be okay. All things on a certain spheric topo map RADIUS fire at same time. But how would 41,253 be done?<br>

So imagine (CMW) dude hammering and claw of hammer swinging- it is a 3d skin which is moving because inertia of hammer coming down on nail. But at any moment it is static. Add flow (wind blow). At any moment flow is static too, but blows with addition of time. Now, find plane perpendicular to flow vector. Now, place this instantaneous plane at the median between pastest and futurest. Now, where this plane at that moment intersects the 3d skin of hammer, ground, up air and over and back down air - this is the ring. Note that ring loves to incorporate intersection with 3d skins but doesn't have to. Story (3d CMW hammer in this case) changes attitude (this is a perceptual phenomenon that just happens), and wind can change which way it is blowing and how fast, and the reference of your head direction can change if you're in a car and turning as driving. And you are moving. But nevertheless you-forward is held as stationary and the world is turned (from a percept standpoint), so don't have to consider that in this example. Anywho, the thing that is held steady is the onion with heading. As the wind blows a "bubble" thru this changing ring, it forms a cavern. Upon this cavern wall may drawn the SPW paint. But, if you're paying attention to SPW while riding in car, there is wind blowing there too (have seen it blow straight forward out of my stomach), which makes a cavern wall upon which Lionel Richie's 3d skin was painted.<br>
<br>
Lionel case - I thot you said wind blows bubble (cavern wall/floor/ceiling) with ring then paints a world (CMW in this case) thereupon - but if so, why does it feel like you know "which world" is getting blown (SPW in this case)? Is it by which is drawn on wall then you know it's the other? Or does paint/skin of world get blown too but you don't notice that as much as the rings and the cavity inside?<br>
<br>
Also Lionel case - upon WHAT was SPW painted in this instance? Would it could it have been drawn on the outside (or inside) of skins of Lionel Richie?? Didn't seem like it. But kinda makes sense cause if there was this mapping of one to another it would be a cool recursive feat! And if so, would it really be drawn on his 3d skin or rather on the plane of the ring? Or sometimes one and sometimes another?<br>
<br>
Why could you see a trapezoid "frame" of painted-inside-with-SPW followed by a quite similar trapezoid "frame" of painted-inside-with-CMW of video of motorcycle with mind's eye lower and looking more at 3:00 not 12:00? In that case both were getting drawn on the same surface and that surface was an expanded bubble of a ring of a larger ring, and possibly making an onion. It's like "good lord" how many layers of complexity are there?! The thing with that instance is that I don't think there was wind.<br>
<br>
Colorness honestly felt like a knowledge of what. Changing of text from navy purple to jet black back and forth is a knowledge of "it's purple!" or "it's black!"- like it is not a visual, but knowledge, thing! And I can pretty much change the color at will by telling my brain it has to be so and so, but can only change so many times cause loses convincingness. <br>
<br>
Black could be the knowledge of not knowing.<br>
Brown could be knowledge of mixture of paints, and white the knowledge of mixture of lights.<br>
<br>
Again the first "knowledge" of id of color is of a  grasp-onto-in-the-dark-then-turn-on-lights-of-linking-to-verbal-to-reveal-say-purple, non-puttable-into-language nature.<br>
<br>
Even within a 50hz(?) "frame," color can movify. Meaning it must be way faster update if needed I guess however fast is needed can be done but it is less a frequency thing and more a paint-when-needed thing. Prolly at least 1ms temporal precision.<br>
<br>
M midnight noise can be stretched into words in your dream. It's mapped into something completely different.<br>
<br>
It's like the only thing that the brain has (sifficient stable consistent so as to draw stable world) precision with is time (unless I'm missing something). Nowhere does there seem to be a crystalline structure that could stably rep space via a mini-charicature. Even the 2D planes of PCs seem to require throwing out except for adding extra precision or something because you can remove cerebellum and be okay. Does it do it by meaning and wind and all this other stuff being written in? Like start with ring from 1d, but then the ring is drawing a shifting scene and shifting cursor so as to gain a sense of 3d therefrom. But again it is felt. How? <br>
<br>
Is consciousness what change feels like? And high amplitude peaks of firing give snapshots (frames)? As such is current vibration picture (high freq vibs) within dendrite system of neuron taken down axon in a particular direction? Or something?<br>

Stomach it will have to get to heart first, but I see do difference I mean inhale vs eat should not send thc to diff areas of brain with diff concentrations. So that's why I said maybe it's all just absorption rate.<br>

Left DLPFC more imp for verbal processes; right dlPFC for visual.<br>
<br>
Mid DLPFC is the very deepest abstract layer (for store with layers and layers of rules), and this is the region having biggest gain in size in human.<br>
<br>
"Imagine playing tennis" supplementary motor cortex lights up. "Imagine walking thru your house" parahippocampal cortex lights up (in non responsive subjects ["locked in"]).<br>

Gyorgi Buzsaki- consolidate during sleep to learn <br>
HIPP is on the top of a big hierarchy - all the sensory hierarchies end @ hippocampus, so it's really a convergence zone for your entire sensorium.<br>
Some trace of experience embedded in hipp during the wake activity. During slow wave sleep, hipp is talking back to cortex with 10 (-hundreds)Hz spindles every 5-10 seconds. REM cortex talks to hipp. Wake cortex talks to hipp.<br>
The storage of hipp is not much compared to cortex; it's not really storage, it's storing the links to the cortex that have to be recovered. Sort of like hash code.<br>
ZOL (sleeping pill) doubles the density of sleep spindles - people can remember 3x more of what they learned the day before!!<br>
Every single thing that has been called an oscillation is actually a traveling wave!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
Can analyze phase to get sense of traveling waves.<br>
In sleep, 10,000 cycles. 50% are circular (rotational), some are expanding.<br>
Of the rotational - 70% CCW, 30% CW.<br>
Now if there is traveling, does cortex paint scene and cerebellum paint body??<br>
<br>
New thot - non-spec nuclei of thalamus sends "10hz" "modulatory" signal which is actually a traveling wave which is actually the rings/sphere/paper depending on mode. Our at least the attitude and a base rate of ring.<br>
<br>
Hippocampus is shape of ring and flow?<br>
<br>
What if you need to subtract out the axons from spatial rep? Retina as 1" sphere (or that conic cutting into sphere you see sometimes) with LGN as broken glass and VC IE V1 as 1" cube? Cause axons don't reverberate whereas dendrites do.<br>
<br>
Could brain use track of waves to rep future to past?<br>
<br>
It could use this for creation of (1) future to past flow of rings cavern and paint on walls, (2) video box, (3) open air with body puzzle pieces blown out showing inertia, (4) others?<br>
<br>
In VC, could gain 5 mm diameter increase in wave diameter per second. This would also make sense with future rings fading in and paster rings fading out.<br>
<br>
Then, could VC really be starting to read some combo of freq pond waves over space and time which freq at any loc could be color there? Whether somehow actual light freq is vibrated there or some much slower one for rep purposes?<br>
<br>
If non-spec thal is driving these traveling waves, then I suppose brainstem spots could be originating or sending info for thal to process. Then shell of thal could have a function too.<br>
<br>
Baby's brain looked like hard switches between CMW and SPW for awhile them changed to swirling.<br>
<br>
Could brainstem even be directing simply by saying which specific neurons within group at any time to fire and thereby guide movements of wave dance on cerebrum?<br>
<br>
Might insula be repping your body and cortex the scene?<br>
<br>
Could left and right insula von economo spiral corkscrew neurons fire and the dielectric from both intersects in middle to provide viewer?<br><br>
<br>
Axons are for relay of a purturbation initiation without creating waves along the way.<br>
<br>
Claustrum is sheet of grey (?) matter b/w insula and putamen!<br>
<br>
Septum is super critical with connections between hipp and vta and na (?) and brainstem (?) and just freaking everything related to hipp theta. Even sets hipp theta!<br>
<br>
H___ H_____ would be unable to speak words but still t____<br>
<br>
So they say you have 120 Hz traveling waves and also 10 Hz traveling waves going all over cortex.<br>
<br>
Note - could it be that ring attitude is held steady in brain except that when you rotate your head, it counter updates just like with eyes holding gaze when turning head? How come you can move head left and right and rings stay put?<br>
<br>
Could hipp help link the full engram (think rat dots everywhere brain) during sleep from slight LTP? And more importantly, could it be able to give info to that 2d slice of engram that corresponds to current 2d attitude slice/ring? Could wonky hipp cells (theta off peev on) provide video clips (?).<br>
<br>
Whatever attitude of rings, you always have a front and back of rings (unless it flips flops then maybe SPW CMW), so you can paint view on one and viewer on other. And you can update the leftover reverberations in real time with glutamate and gaba neurons. Then white could be vibration in axial shaft and color could be 0-2n angle rotation in apical dendrites, and even angular getting closer to axial could be lighter colors - it would be energy, but axial energy. Would provide a sense of compressions and rarefactions to viewer (em radiation) for white, and tangential waves for colors! Brown could be a mishmash of polarizations rendering muddy!<br>
<br>
If red were fundamental 0Â°, is that relative to ring or relative to head or relative to cartoonified drawing of viewer? I think relative to ring.<br>
<br>
Color could also somehow be done using front and back of dendrites (apical and basal).<br>
<br>
The one mapped onto the other could be apical and basal dendrites with one shaft, or just connecting two "engrams."<br>
<br>
The whole brain does double duty not only as a computer but also as a screen projector for conscious scenes and as track for ring. It could be that brain cancels out calculator from conscious painting via inhibition or via constraining it mostly to a separate layer.<br>

Dream this morning - in hotel <br>
Cards ran out of money so turned volume of TV down. One good card was powering 4 pairs of wires to provide very good sound. I put card in front of wallet and set it down. Some movie with bloody. I was running for mayor against some guy and i just gave up cause ran out of money and therefore good sound music. Walked into bathroom with two girls cause they wanted to "shave" in there naked with me which was cool but right as I'm taking my clothes off looking at them (they already naked), in real life I get a call from Google ad customer ðŸ¤¯ and therefore had to awake and leave dream.<br>
<br>
Maybe APs are 1-way to prevent reverb interference w consciousness <br>
<br>
Hash code could be in hipp and could be the ineffable thing you grasp to "id" a thing before seeing the enneagram on cortex surface which reps(? and) allows movement to all kinds of "meaningful" id tags like sounds waves desc, image of mouth desc, mental image of thing, letters used to write id name, etc.<br>
<br>
I don't think hipp does paint-current-scene-by-layers-of-memory cause alz still have vision but who knows. Maybe VC helps kick paint-by-memory into action. But remember that alz remember songs (and ost episodic?) but can't id things. Maybe pfc helps with sequential memory and hence isn't lost in alz.<br>
<br>
<br>
Is it engram or enneagram. It's engram. An enneagram is a 9 pointed stellate polygon or 9-divisioned personality test.<br>
<br>
Is the encoded audio in APs or dendrites? What about imagined? Should lead to vibration of rings.<br>
<br>
If ppl with a chunk of cortex removed or screwed don't have a loss in scene anywhere, maybe this theory of double duty isn't correct. Maybe I have to scrap this. Darn, it looked promising. Well, wait. Maybe thalamus learns (with help from cerebellum) that that area ain't reliable anymore and hence avoids it. So perhaps we can salvage it.<br>
<br>
Maybe stimulation of pfc didn't result in scene bc it wasn't meaningful info. But PHZ had structure to go on and make scene when stimulated.<br>
<br>
I think sensory and motor homonculus are only incidental and tidy cabling/order. Actual percept homonculus is drawn wherever. Don't make too much of cabling. Like visual cortex. Like the brain is saying "we can do better than that!"<br>
<br>
"Forty two seventy seven, nine THREE... forty two seventy seven, nine THREE... forty two seventy seven, nine THREE" I created the audio of this speech in my mind while getting into car to plug into app- mostly I stored the audio only for lateral dorsal (?) prefrontal holding, tho a little the image. This was over about 24 heartbeats (about 14 seconds cause heartbeat a little faster than normal). In this duration there would be about 100 hippocampal theta waves (33 hippocampal theta waves [4.6 seconds] during just one saying of it committing to temp memory).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
youâ€™re probably looking at the same imagination on hallucinogens only sped the hell up sped the hell up sped the hell up whereas weed you see your imagination but slowed the hell down. The spinning thalamus. Tho thalami separated, they act as if they were one conjoined sphere.<br>
FILLER: So I had this idea that MAYBE the thalami together serve as the seat of the "spinning 3D sprinkler" or apparent centering point of rings (and they're getting drawn by this sprinkler/gun that spins around and is spitting stuff [ink of consciousness] out all the time), but that would imply a sort of neurospatial means of creating perception, so I think it is FALSE. However, there does seem to be something WITHIN PERCEPTUAL SPACE of a center thing spinning and this ring getting printed. Could just be a reference point as cortex builds story of consciousness.<br>

Thermal (infrared) camera to picture brain in total dark room (cold or shield suit below head)? But I think skull even blocks radiant heat. Nope it doesn't 10% of 800-830nm infrared gets thru.<br>

Is CMW skin only, and paint on there is SPW. <br>
<br>
Does the brain keep track of the distance needed at any shortcoming crannies (to make it a perfect sphere/cube) or horizontal gaps and eliminate them out just like with blood vessels of eyes?<br>
<br>
Perhaps if you lose the cerebellum (story?), you lose the "soul" aspect of consciousness without knowing it - still see movie of external characters and machinery still there - but not as precise either. The flocculus of cerebellum is older than cerebrum - would make sense, as story is the weightier thing.<br>
<br>
Perhaps rings made around tube at brainstem (evolutionarily oldest), and flow does provide flow by sympathetic vibrations in hex molecules flowing along.<br>
<br>
What things don't have flow? Was gonna say puzzle piece body, but I think it is just slow flow there.<br>
<br>
If rings are in brainstem, vibrations prolly are too, tho that could be cerebrum.<br>
<br>
Future to Past could be <br>
<br>
Claustrum - plan joining of left right cortex. Levels of wakefulness ARAS.<br>
<br>
May be seeing edges of ring (ring is visible) when high cause slight time delays of nothing allow you to see change in drawing of consciousness between those two current and past frame.<br>
<br>
Kite & string - pull on string is substantia nigra (muscles), "air"/"jello" resistance is inertia and gravity wanting to prevent you walking up the hill. Perhaps since it is a kite air goes around edge and puzzle piece begins to be made.<br>
<br>
Giant bubble maker hang glider & free fall forward - since it's not a kite but a ring, you are falling and air rushing past you, also since a ring you blow cavern wall bubbles.<br>
<br>
AC- could be bad capacitor going to compressor; could be stuck reversing valve; could be bad contactor not signaling to switch reversing valve (?). Just remember this unit was working beautifully then suddenly something went awry.<br>
<br>
Could folia be repping bank mini contributions by laser zap of sides plus top?<br>
<br>
What if engram is a specific collection of paintbrushes?<br>
<br>
Talked to hipp to get I'd dentist <br>
<br>
What if bank is brain plus brainstem and it anti-moves rep of world when you roll head so that bank always appears up even when it isn't.<br>
<br>
Gave CMW rep of biting down on finger just before my finger with sushi got close to inside mouth so that muscles would pay attention to waiting for proper moment for biting down. I learned my lesson from painful things in past! Pain no doubt stores memories for avoidance. When no longer a threat, cb1 helps you to erase that it is a threat.e ring placed on all those memory saves of those SPWs? Not really consistent.<br>
