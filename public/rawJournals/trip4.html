<h1>Raw Journals: Trip 4</h1>

<p>The following are notes from 2/11/22 (taking two legal hemp gummies) and extra filler added later in contemplation. The reason there are typos is because I swiped it all out with my finger on my iPhone as quickly as I could and didn't want to lose thoughts by going back when iPhone keyboard was being stupid. Some of the things I can no longer tell exactly what word I was going for, so I'm leaving the text alone. I think the most philosophical thought can be gotten from it that way. I add filler here and there to help provide context/meaning. These notes should be taken in a philosophical way - I write everything down that comes to mind without checking it; then I can check and consider the things later. Thus, statements that appear as fact may be me looking at something a certain way and trying it on, but it doesn't mean that I fully agree with it. These notes are more like grasping to try to understand consciousness and just things in general.<br>
<br>
Took 1 chill 1 euphoria <br>
<br>
Waters, notes, papers, backpack, pens, vegan meals, tent, pillow, sleeping bag, checkbook, eu + ch. Waders. Warm. Cbd vape + bottle.<br>
<br>
Nose is becoming an igloo - eggaretaed memories to a little cold weather on nose. 5:14. Holy crap time must be going slow!!! I figured 6 by now walking back and forth on this trail cause car.<br>
<br>
K___ acts kinda stoned that's why you kinda like ____ <br>
<br>
You have to determine who to be to one or another person interaction.<br>
<br>
You still have animal fear at skeleton ie predator. You (sobers) ->evolutionarily wise.<br>
<br>
I wish I could serve You, right? Written into story too and the feeling of expressing that.<br>
<br>
The story -ground (walking on) is written into as much as your feeling of it. Those are the two sides - the universe and the observer - in the story. See now why it's 4th D? 5:24 heading back.<br>
<br>
The watching of recording video written. A frown is a familiar pattern of transitions between rings rings included.<br>
<br>
You 4th D can see 1 the movie or 2 can see the 3D tunnel of focus which is your perceptions (you). They can see or feel it. Outside inside videos going at once.<br>
<br>
Walking is good memories from past that's why walking becomes enjoyable once done. You're using some of the same frames. Like maranatha frames and leaves frames.<br>
<br>
Walking by music woodclock Christmas. Christmas has many memories. Just that text word. 5:39 "who you talking to down there?" at time.<br>
Don't come up here cause I want to be over that. Also said you rock for it it's brave.<br>
<br>
Multiple preople can be in a ring (a story). Your brain can create them.<br>
<br>
Tom written in bank. You come across him.<br>
<br>
The bank can be spun around. Lying sideways glass faced anti gravity up. I think bank spun around is same as "world spun by spider," and may be the angles and speed of "jettison" of past frames(rings). Bank spun around can enable choice of a ring which befits the choice of focus at the moment and that intersection makes ring.<br>
<br>
You movify by creating more 3d traces per second (increase frequency) within sampled section.<br>
<br>
Walking seeing traces of 3d swinging arms must have been about 20Hz. I think corkscrew still 2-4Hz, maybe more like 4.<br>
<br>
6:12am <br>
<br>
The meaning is written into the change of the rings. Cold, color, etc. It all has its own angle 41,253 of what was focused last to what's focused now.<br>
<br>
The slowing and starting of arms (horizontal slice but really just whole 3d body and world) can be seen cause you are still walking but one arm goes faster than walking, then same as walking, then slower than walking, stopping, reversing direction, increased speed in reversed direction, etc. All these 3D rings (a spheric [not round though - blobular] body shapes!) define the starts and stops.<br>
<br>
What if we are in reverse and touch receptors and retina are where we determine 41,253 of spot on 3d "sphere" of our body, and our ultimate goal is to downsize and crawl into our mothers womb and return to counterspace? Life in reverse makes more sense as it is evolution to good mostly.<br>
<br>
What if the 41,253 pinwheels in layers 2,3 are for determining 41,253 angle on every point of your body? And this angle "writes" what emotion or percept is felt to the 4D viewers?<br>
<br>
Was cold a sort of horizontal thing?<br>
<br>
What direction and with what speed are you jettisoning the previous "rings"?<br>
<br>
Possibly there can be two separate rings one focusing on body and another on a noise outside. Didn't have super clear rings this time so dunno.<br>
<br>
Not necessarily anything :<br>
<br>
<br>
Viewed color is smoother than other precepts because it is 50Hz and random at that (overlap?).<br>
<br>
In the (perception) rendering, there is the color and there is the observing of the color by the you shape.<br>
<br>
Ring can be :<br>
<br>
<br>
If firings are not topographic, then they can't have an origin point reference point so it's just the relationships (spatial distances) between firings (various neurons representing various  points) hence rings is a very good model.<br>
<br>
Could layer 2,3 pinwheels be representing 41,253 (perpendicularity) and layer 4 or 5 be representing spots on the ring or body blob (ie be making the ring, but not topographically)? Hence why any part of cerebral cortex can represent preception and losing large chunks isn't particularly bad because you still have plenty other you can use? If hippocampus getting knocked out abolishes old memories, it's abolishing the bank or access to the bank. If alzheimers takes away past largely and ability to retain new stuff (I am your daughter!) for 30 minutes or more, what is it doing? Where in the brain is the bank?<br>
<br>
Layer 2,3 makes connections to all neurons representing the same incoming stimuli (line at 45¬∞ to 55¬∞) each within a pinwheel of different 41,253 vector, but each representing the same incoming stimuli. All this at one point one pixel one voxel in the view (double check). Of course, the direction that pinwheel is pointing wouldn't have topographic meaning. Maybe somehow it has memory meaning.<br>
<br>
Heartbeat may be normal most fundamental frames.<br>
<br>
The _____ approach is getting passed around. Her -> me -> on. It's a frame but it has meaning.<br>
<br>
Is there any dissociation between layers 2,3 and 4,5 with ketamine??? Maybe in that region? Could consciousness be generated there (PMC) in full? And dissociation between input?? Altho I thot that path (thalamic nuclei, pfc/hot) was output.<br>
<br>
You have a certain phase lag (of meaning, not of time) encoded in every pinwheel of neocortex (which phase lag is shared networked together on all the pinwheels). Are pinwheels everywhere or just Vc?<br>
<br>
There's the body (moving) and there's the ground (spot changing). Both are being written out, but only body encodes also for feeling. The hand could even been thot of as a in-and-out-motion of the air cause the 3d shape is like from your body to ground and body is an air cavity in it.<br>
<br>
Could rings be "what parts of blob body and ground do you want to give focus to ie what parts do you want to enliven into perception via "perpendicularaity"?"?<br>
<br>
Rings of Fire: A Theory of Consciousness <br>
<br>
With a mafia (cfed to 70s), honesty ain't always the best most moral policy. Like dude in ot lied to mfer.<br>
<br>
120 bpm heartbeat sober<br>
<br>
Next - please specify HOW change between rings encodes for perception. What angle/distance gives rise to what qualia? Apparently "flat gives rise to cold" ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.<br>
<br>
I think the hippocampus (?) uses memory frames(rings) to create the day's perceptions, but then as you sleep it may add a few rings to the block from that day. In this way, you always stay tied to your roots. Also, you forget the linked stuff and just save bare bones more and more both as you get older and as you use that frame. The memory behind frames is usually subconscious as frames usually go so quickly and "imperceptibly."<br>
<br>
Violin in pride and prejudice "used" a frame with Handel messiah and architect book on first house and that mood.<br>
<br>
Feet and hands movement is spider handling the world. <br>
<br>
Though rings can paint your thought speech if you're focused on it, I think a separate region of brain (pfc?) holds something like if you're trying to remember this thought to write it down or remembering a gas total to plug into app. You can say remember this, then focus on getting into your car, then get phone and RECALL the price and plug it in.<br>
<br>
Perhaps getting something 90¬∞ out of sync with (phase lagged) background theta or whatever frequency is what helps enable it to POP OUT just like an antenna. Like place cells or like anything. Except neurons don't have negative. Just on and off.<br>
<br>
What is there were a super being (beyond human, less than God) that could imagine things in great acuity and accuracy and full color and in 3D. They could literally build engineered things in their minds. That's quite possible, just hasn't happened in any animal or human brains.<br>
<br>
Some scientists call 41,253 "the scene," or "the naturalistic 3D framework."<br>
<br>
You have as much (free) will as the extent of complexity and nuance of your filter and if-then mechanisms of neural coding in your pfc.<br>
<br>
Rings of Fire: The Constructs of Consciousness <br>
<br>
Ought to try looking at bank (glass) face down (I bet it'll be head direction up) and also standing on head (I bet it'll be head direction up).<br>
<br>
Text on space shuttle or anti gravity may define allocentric vector (anti gravity up), something (head direction up + gaze net amount of vector perpendicular to anti-gravity?) needed to enable distinction and keep it from "spinning" about anti-gravity axis; head direction up seems important, eye gaze towards seems to define egocentric vector as well as bend of neck, whole of body, and anti-gravity or the relation thereto.<br>
<br>
Which way am I looking at space? Eye direction yes kinda, but chest direction and feet direction seem to play a role.<br>
<br>
THE BRAIN JUST STARTS DRAWING SOMEWHERE (TO DRAW THE RINGS). It needn't an origin reference point. The perceptual is not linked in orientation or scale to reality nor need it be. HOW DOES IT DRAW AND MOVE IN XYZ OR PINWHEEL PLUS RADIUS PLUS DIVERGENCE? That is the fundamental question of consciousness!<br>
<br>
I would bet 0-360¬∞ pinwheel is done temporally in a phasic manner, radius is done possibly via # of spikes (but more likely in a slightly higher relational way, such as a population of neurons represents close, father, father, etc.), and deviation up or down could be done by a splitting up of previous population, with some representing lotsa deviation up, some a little deviation up, some right on, some a little deviation down, and some a lot of deviation down.<br>
<br>
There is a ring of focus even tho the 3d world it represents intersecting also is created, but in a more background way. I think that is your stumblingblock.<br>
<br>
The ring can always be mapped to a 2D surface, and may be created as 2D with something else providing sense of 3D which gives depth or height scale to parts of it.<br>
<br>
Next time you're high, pay close attention to ring if one goes on wall and ceiling - where exactly does it go? How does it cross the air? Does the brain deemphasize large intervening chunks of the ring or simply you only pay attention to certain locations on ring so as to prevent rings from being as visible but rather a whole "scene"?<br>
<br>
I bet there is a cursor that precesses the phase of the background 3d noise of body and world and traces out the ring of focus, and the only rule is that things be connected spatially on ring (unless with like a distance break as arm to sudden ground way further away suddenly) as it goes from spot to spot. Particular spots on the ring get extra focus (louder firing? Recruitment of hippocampus or pfc?), to the tune of about 4-6 things per ring. If the specific thing is a visual thing, it must precess its 50 Hz gamma partners. If the specific thing is audio, it must precess its 20 Hz (?) beta partners. If the specific thing is a place cell (?), it must precess its 7 Hz (?) theta partners.<br>
<br>
This would mean there must be exquisite precision in timing, given sometimes 20 Hz rings, and all the spots on the ring must add at least another 100 more, requiring at least 2,000 Hz precision. But maybe not. The 3 Hz rings requiring 100 more would be 300 Hz precision, much more believable. Perhaps as ring rate increases, samples per ring need not be as high and may decrease accordingly.<br>
<br>
If this is correct, precise timing (and integration with meaning of where surrounding region of ring is) is what gives accuracy to painting of where you heard a noise for example. A ring which first represents "left elbow shall open" could be neurons firing in right premotor or motor cortex; followed by mood posteriorly given by neurons anterior in the anterior cingulate cortex; followed by a noise in right hearing field generated by left auditory cortex neurons; followed by inertial head tilt given by neurons in left motor cortex. The neurons needn't be connected to each other as long as they are connected phasically in who precesses their neighbors at what very specific moment. Something must keep track of what the frequency of rings is at any given moment since it changes.<br>
<br>
I honestly think the rf->non-specific neurons of thalami->cortex provides the background 3d stuff we're not as aware of (in sense of paying close attention to or remembering), and may determine the RING RATE. Remember, they don't DRIVE but merely MODULATE the cortex (give it a benchmark (?)). So rf->non->cortex is usually about 10-20 Hz (can be slowed with cannabis) and may provide FREQUENCY OF RINGS at any given moment. THEN, EXACTLY WHEN (PHASICALLY) WITHIN ANY ONE CYCLE a neuron precesses it's neighbors (be they 50 Hz, 20 Hz, 7 Hz, whatever), it makes an entrance as a portion of the ring (with some other region of brain [cerebellum? retrosplenial cortex? pfc?] sending error flags if something isn't compatible or just downright suppressing it from precessing enough to be heard)(in fact, perhaps the cerebellum must PLAN what may emerge in ring since it may know the transforms to consider 3d space allocentrically and egocentrically [or perhaps the retrosplenial cortex does this or the cerebellum with the RSP, or other hot spots of focal navigation like superior colliculi or visual eye fields or attentional fields]).!! And I don't think precessing is even required if phasic to rf is maintained but it would be nice to make it pop. Requiring precessing means you may not have the necessary bandwidth for 20-100 samples within ring, but then again since mini regions of brain are a bit out of sync with each other and randomized that may allow for greater bandwidth of sampling within an already 20 Hz limited ring. The globus pallodus together with other brain regions could be controlling the specific timing of firing of spots on ring via inhibition of parts of thalami. Hence the thalami could feel like one central hub spitting out a ring via rotational movement, even tho there is no rotation or topographical rings going on, but rather phasic planned sensible ones. Would suprachiasmatic nuclei and or nucleus accumbens have to do with some drugs causing a sense of thalami increasing or decreasing this "spin" rate? Probably. And with time slowing down? Yes I think. Therefore does rf pair with globus palludus/supra/accum to ensure more or less one spin per cycle? And does this pairing of the two break down with enough dmt so that you feel space itself is churning and expanding? Quite possibly!<br>
<br>
Then you have the question of the 2-4 Hz corkscrew laying of live video 3D focal but then also boxified painted jello film thingy. I mean RSP is prolly CAUSE of rate, and drives parts of thalami and DRIVES OR MODULATES a secondary lower frequency pattern on parietal cortex. How exactly does this interesting jello story get made? It seems to be absolutely at the top of the chain of information processing and generates STORY.<br>
<br>
And what of PFC which seems more to be paying attention to the bass tab and trying to play well? How exactly is that done?<br>
<br>
You also have the ebb and flow over the BANK which ebb and flow is about 0.25 Hz. What does this? And WHERE is the bank? Hippocampus? Cortex?<br>
<br>
Try to see if you can see transition between rings and 3D hand. Is it a ring outline or a spheric outline? How do rings make the 3D surface style outline?<br>
<br>
You know, front half is always motor; back half is sensory. Soooo, I think pfc builds impartial world surfaces plus body surfaces. I think hz plus precuneate plus retrosplenial plus posterior cingulate plus maybe hippocampus does "what it feels like to you." Then, you can "watch" either or both movies. Close your eyes and you're just watching "what it feels like to you." Are there 3 body images? One seen, one constructed by pfc proprioception (prolly not cause proprioception is on sensory half and goes to sensory center), and created by sensory? You looking at movie made by Vc may be PMC sampling PFC at a slower rate, but usually in sync with it (?). Maybe frequency IS looking. Maybe frequency is the creation of an observer.<br>
<br>
Cerebellum may be an interaction point with incoming outgoing body movement and position stuff. Or is cerebellum the looker at brain or embuer with felt meaning? Or the creator of afterburn to ensure percepts last long enough to be experienced?<br>
<br>
There is a jennifer Aniston neuron (in those that care about such) that responds to her face, a picture of her face, a drawing of her face, and even just her name written. I tried to recall girly up north I knew the face/person first and couldn't stimulate name portion of brain enough to gather, so I stimulated part with her sister and got z_____ (last name) immediately. Then I inquired for sister first name and got _____. Then I enquired for her married name and got ____. Then I really focused and inquired for girly plus w___/z___ and finally got h___. You even have to inquire for the spelling of h____ because just the oral/audio feeling of |h___| comes first - to get the spelling you have to inquire and there may be multiple ways to spell a phonetic name. Same with ______. I matched with the audio/speak of |____| prior to even worrying about whether I knew how to spell it. That shows brain matches with the minimal most memorable part of anything. H_____ ___ z_______ ____. Jumping on trampoline bare feet. Ha, I definitely have a ________ neuron and I used to think her last name was E______. ______ e_____, but it isn't. By now _____ z_____ sounds more right cause my brain learned to mostly forget the first thing.<br>
<br>
Family member neurons (Dad, Grandma) have a different filter than work buddy neurons. You portray a different character. All people neurons have different filters. These people neurons and the rules you learn for them or just the not having of rules play a big part in personality, as well as your own personality on top of all that.

TWO OTHER PEOPLE'S THOUGHTS ON CONSCIOUSNESS<br>
<br>These are notes from two other people who have seen something akin to what I call the "bank" drawing out consciousness. I am leaving them anonymous as I'd want their permission prior to placing their names here.<br><br>
2/14/22 (personOne)<br>
<br>
Saw maybe a bank. Very hard to focus on, extremely tiny. A vortex spinning very fast (maybe his bank spins faster than mine?), blackest black ever, spinning in 3D fashion, waves about 1 Hz coming off it. Try to focus on and it goes away or spins so fast you can't keep up. Off center? Nope dead dead center microscopic. Blurs out. A cloud engulfs it and self destructs then reappears. Not shrink to nothing. Like radioactive metal and it can send off poofs and whatever it sends off affects everything. Looked 1 cm cubed.<br>
<br>
An 8-ball trapped inside a clear cube. The stuff just outside it obscures it.<br>
<br>
Like sand on a bass drum.<br>
<br>
Like personTwo 20-sided dice with tiny pinhole w vortex coming out or in don't know.<br>
<br>
Saw colored green or orange auras like if you look at a person's third eye but focus attention on the air around their head, or on hand but around it.<br>
<br>
Felt like room was spinning around quite fast (but still with stable whole scene?).<br>
