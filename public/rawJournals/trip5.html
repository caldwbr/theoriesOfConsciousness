<h1>Raw Journals: Trip 5</h1>

<p>The following are notes from 3/3/22 (taking two legal hemp gummies) and extra filler added later in contemplation. The reason there are typos is because I swiped it all out with my finger on my iPhone as quickly as I could and didn't want to lose thoughts by going back when iPhone keyboard was being stupid. Some of the things I can no longer tell exactly what word I was going for, so I'm leaving the text alone. I think the most philosophical thought can be gotten from it that way. I add filler here and there to help provide context/meaning. These notes should be taken in a philosophical way - I write everything down that comes to mind without checking it; then I can check and consider the things later. Thus, statements that appear as fact may be me looking at something a certain way and trying it on, but it doesn't mean that I fully agree with it. These notes are more like grasping to try to understand consciousness and just things in general.<br>
<br>
Took 1 chill 1 euphoria <br>
<br>
Actually started 3/2/22, but saw just stuff post midnight up to 3:00 AM. GOT UP at 9:00 AM. Now it's 11:00 AM as I type this filler note.<br>
<br>
High Qs.<br>
Which direction is cold hot smell etc.?<br>
Hot and cold might be inhibition on vibration in a certain direction remember gaba interneurons in cortex have to do something. I'm no longer seeing rings clear enough to see which vibrational direction or what.<br>
Which way rings in mirror <br>
I think with visual field so into mirror but it's understood that stuff is behind.<br>
What exactly in a single ring <br>
The intersection between story world and physical representation world - conveys casted position of each spot as well as lots of info about that spot (back of shirt, etc.).<br>
Faster-f rings used to paint color and higher-f stuff. Audio uses everything from theta to gamma as music requires. Highest frequency of audio may be represented within single neuron's intra-dendritic space. Maybe ion channels here.<br>
It's where the info is. It can be in intra-dendritic stuff.<br>
Rings can morph into portraying story the then shape is the ring in a different story. In an ever rotating into this extra D sense way.<br>
Orientation of bank and more about bank <br>
<br>
<br>
You imagine a face speaking when you hear words eyes closed. Eyes open, that visual image dominates instead of seeing rings cause it's more stable than seeing the rings tho they are there and likely provide sense of you-movement, or imagined mouth movement.<br>
<br>
Filler: When you hear someone say something you are using your images of mouth to say it in cartoon and represent it hence they can cast their ideas upon you if you're not careful. Remember science article about importance of being able to visualize mouth to understand speech?<br>
Filler: Sth(stairway to heaven) ring of guitar left, flute right, vocal center all at once but can focus on one - 3 rings "at once" kinda. Other PersonOne- I can identify with that (and with cartoons).<br>
Tilroy to buy hexas cannabis debt up to 212 million.<br>
Rings makes evolutionary sense - the junction been two worlds - motor and sensory - to bind it all together not just left v right or just sight v sound (well sight v sound may be sensory v motor) - but anchored sensory [filler: but the sensors move and rotate!] and moving motor. I suspect like layers 5,6 give ring intersection and PHZ layer 2,3 builds scaffolding of representation of physical world and PFC/motor cortex layer 2,3 builds cartoon 2d rings image movie depicting motion (hence learn Olympic beauty skill via visualization of movement cartoon)<br>
Remember PHZ can start with 2d ring and just use a smaller model back of shirt will "cast" both attitude and distance of "viewer."<br>
Looking internal (inside ring) is motor. Looking PHZ IS open air.<br>
<br>
Filler: the ring isn't so much a ring of focus in model of physical world but rather a ring of reference or origin for the sake of the PHZ to know orientation and such for adding of models. When you look at that "world" you rarely look at rings but rather the "content" "higher-f" stuff that remains unchanging or not changing much or changing in sensible ways whereas ring positions in model of physical world are very random (but not random for movement or I think audio).<br>
<br>
Filler (remembered): "rate of rings doesn't matter that much cause you can have gamma putting it at gamma rate and theta putting it at theta rate."<br>
<br>
Your body is always stationary anchored to bank even while driving. The scenary changes but it's like holding your phone in hand. Car being stationary with you it gains a familiarity and a little sense of your soul I.<br>
<br>
Maybe color blind can't build scaffold or cant vibrate it color way. Does color at depth provide strong depth clue when lack of motion?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Or is there a spin" extra D rings modeling this speech then start spinning along ring itself. This constant shifting between worlds is prolly the dissociation which is usually married.<br>
<br>
These rings draw out a shape that is moving in a story. You go from EC seeing an outline 2D slice of a soccer ball being kicked to a solid plane of iPhone (viewed) talking about soccer balls. That's the big difference between EC and EO you mentioned the first time. You can still emphasize ring frame element of 3D world in EO tho- depends on what focus is on 2D screen or story of words being created visualized movified in soccer kick example - the story arises from the 2d screen mostly perpendicular and up towards face the rate it's going is it would reach face during duration of 1 heartbeat high (about 2 Hz?), tho veers off.<br>
It's like a theatrical performance movie projection. With yea a seer.<br>
The cube is a tool. Georgia skewered at 30°, (also a leg like female) 3D boxify of shape of state, but not boxy edges - meaning in extra-D slope. The flow of action of this movie is about the same as the speed of walking (that Hz of feet focus tho many frames in a second many frames between two footsteps so feeling like much higher velocity). Toe bend going back and forth from appearance at the front of cube to back and vice versa, using toe bend 3D frames models animation those whole models being 3D ink writing on (of) bank. Prolly why a cat so enjoys putting his claws in and out - his bank models them blown up and it's more meaning then. So not just sphere and cube and glass - toe Bends, Tom Mitchells in action whoa Mitchell has a ton of memories!! This is that meaning of "see meaning at different conic angle." (Filler: wtf that even mean? FillerFiller: I think it means the text of the word Mitchell it looks like a narrower conic angle of it coming out narrower than usual and somehow you see the memory frames in layers of depth. Still tho, wtf.). Mitchell draws a shape with so many temporaly varied frames/rings. (Filler: almost like snapshots [at right attitude] from multiple movie-memory-episode relating to him?). Like that glass chair we sat on. (Filler: brain makes "all the 41,253 angles" at same time, but not really all - it takes a little time and multiple fresh exposure to really get it good?) All the beach chairs you've been in, we can write (it's a projection and a "seer" sees it- can be internal to your brain!!) There are rings created as a baby and then later growing up, each respective brings its own feel and associated frames. Wanna think about something you use more of its old frames for rabbit trail ideas. You do different plane 90° turn (pivot) to get between audio sounds or far points far away from ring and change ring attitude quickly.<br>
You eye at bottom of cube and looking upwards towards object or sky. It's a 2D ring (plane of firing, usually a ring?) made by firing of a part of that cube, geometrically speaking (interpreting).<br>
Filler: mushrooms "flood with serotonin" hence highlighting of motor cartoon; cannabis dissociated motor from sensory hence highlighting effect of motor cartoon.<br>
It can have scale octave up (in distance represented by ring) ie order of magnitude up, and then up from there, but formers are fading away. The story( after read comes up from this screen) is being pushed thru the static stable 2D intersection with your 3D world of physical existence and coming up toward for face (longer than one heartbeat to get to your nose tho it veers off, and in a different geometrical realm.) same size rings can model different ranges even to the moon cause you imagine it as a concept - however far it is in comic book!!!! The imprint of past rings stores the head direction representation say moving head but not focal selection of foveas. This is why it takes time to grasp meaning of someone speaking LIKE _____ (maybe his attitude can change very fast his fast spinning vortex hence he can latch on quickly to anyone's meaning hence why socially adept)-the lag that you can't immediately move from one thing to a very different one in 2D-highlight-plane-of-bank-ATTITUDE / POSITION IN CUBE. There's a sagittal representation of your hand s in involvement, and a horizontal, and a coronal. You can transition in thought between one idea and another, merging physical shape comparison focus 2D ring of focus on one world and focus on another (story changes attitude of view) you see those two viewers viewing. Don't worry about rings tracing along walls and stuff. You can go thru air right beside you (3d beside your body) rather than strict with body in ring meaning/selection cause the whole 3d physical universe representation is built into the paint of this jello and kinda hovers detached. That plane is stable (and moving a little) across rings cause something faster writes it and rings can focus on moved spots of phone relative to last frames. You have arrow size of letter t. That's why so tiny in other time! b has two colors dark navy blue and blue grey top - bluegrey top, navy at bottom half of style of b. Similar with circle of b. Similar with period. Only with both eyes open. No can do with just one too. Rotation of screen L via hand in real world sections of reflectivity are grey across whole letter. Meaning is embedded in movement of story Ring becomes a star. It just needs info for a planar twist. Maybe delta wave is the coloration. That's how it suppresses all unnecessary stuff from being conscious by the exsquivette meaning in the story at hand. There are movements in body at 2/heatbeat while frames faster and velocity of story move slightly slower than the body movements tho movement depicted by movie faster. On your side bank you orient with frames depicting the story of a person lying down rings coronal (same as vertical in story world) Kinda stagnant and falling down and reappearing. Yea attitude of <br>
What if rings draw you out attitude of plane, things of plane, plane of view on the bank geometrical "fits-within-this-3d-space-of-this-geon" geons aren't needed abstract. THE RING (Which is the brain's one and only thing to make consciousness soar above noise) DOESN'T NEED TO SHOW THE WHOLE GEON- usually the background focus context <br>
All you need for rings is spiral (movement of film thru zed)- a phasic circle, with distance out of ring.<br>
41,253 angle of arm and distance to from radius origin can do 2 1/2D squiggly ring which you can also normalize to a plane and get just straight 2D which is cartoon outline.<br>
The wash of subdelta keeps variation cause frames with water high enough in cube to go with that water line are DIFFERENT ones than for lower water. You can have as fine vibration as you want (up to like 100Hz or whatever you can generate) embedded into ring story.the gamma waves place frames 50+ Hz, but place their rings in the 3d spaces between rings, so it's not hard and not much variation. The higher frequencies all of them can be written into rings using code of the ring shape cause they need to know how to vary from this and THE BINDING PROBLEM is SOLVED!!!!!!!!<br>
EACH successive ring horizontal moves an object along the path around ring as a wave. In this way waves are fundamental of our percept existence. Rings don't have to be planar - they can be bent -they just must fit in cube, and go from 2D to wavy to pattern within 3D cube.<br>
Your brain does two stories at once! The story of this Geometrical bank/sun, a story within a story - the Geometrical <br>
Head rotates rings go out they show the rotation. These rings at base of ice cube with water level (intersection) quite low. as in story which matches story of physical world quite accurately<br>
Head up in story, head up in ice cube up direction, turn head to side the rings moved laterally horizontal plane along cube cube stayed anti-gravity up, focal attitude represented changed, but rings quite similar in say altitude. You can create inertia behind a percept feeling of moving of head just by varying definition of selection of scene on ring and the interpreted speed of movement that occurred therein - it's a lever action cheat in extra D (Filler: tf? I don't see that need more than 2D, much less a 4th D!)<br>
Colors :<br>
Maybe the two Grey's are left eye right eye and that merging of multiple spots along letters creates consistent all together blend.<br>
Closer to screen multiple letters could be grey1 vs grey2.<br>
It's a highly tuned plane along cube <br>
Your body is holding this phone in hand the outline of phone screen is the nexus between that story world moving toward you thru screen outline sometimes in shape of story and sometimes in shape of physical world focus ring ie screen.<br>
Your imagination model become disjointed from Physical world in eyes closed. The movement of story world thru frame goes away and new attitude appears with story world of new story draw even if similar modeled content to model done in different way.<br>
It's 40Hz drawing out something more stable than rings Geometrical use of cube again! More than one thing modeled on cube at same time - face of screen 50 Hz definition of edges etc story, with another frequency of rings giving outline of body and world in story. The phone screen cocked at angle in cube with left hand - this phone-in-hand is in several somewhat overlapping locations<br>
Rings of Connection between storyworld depiction of meaning and goings of lifestory AND selection on the physical universe of focal points but still within-circle spiral at high enough speed. So when ring is representing body, the storyworld had to predict and "be pulled in towards those frames it would need." It had to transition to that. So there are transitions built into learned circuitry. You have to shlosh thru coronal like rings at certain parabolas of thrust movement to emulate certain memories. You have to get at the "right frequency" throw velocity - say slowed down.<br>
After Image of phone flag is on sphere within cube at higher res than rings therefore independent feeling of location size and attitude of rings easily suppressed. Gamma suppresses our focus on rings to rather sense of place-ment of physical world 3d puzzle it models (because that-modeled can be "looked at/paid attention to" as its own entity), eyes closed we can more easily see the rings and the story they model.<br>
Bin ocular pairing of meaning (physical world patches, story patches). Can change from sagittal to horizontal to coronal in ice cube plane which changes perspective but that also has its own little digression. Orientation of meaning world changes painted by change between rings (RINGS INCLUDED) and moves are in a different 3d angle way than orientation of physical universe representation. Modeling world, modeling story using rings off a cube - maybe the two layers of cortex <br>
Gamma paints 3d skeleton outline "ring" of physical world/body; theta to beta paints ring of story from cube the changes in location on cube correspond to changes to the ring size wave and attitude AND THE THRUST between frames. And story only needs 2D component of 3D shape selection (?), plus attitudinal change distance change and wave change and <br>
The ring is the transduction transmodification between the two worlds and the selection on each is the same or at least the one planar 2D component of 3D shape of one gives rise to possibly differing <br>
You only have to connect TWO THINGS!!!!! TWO POSSIBLE COMPLEX MEANINGS FOR EACH LOCATION ON RING PATCHES OF EACH INTERSPERSED POSSIBLY. The ring is the concept we brain evolved to link incoming digital data to to a 3d Geometrical woodwork and thereby cast it and embue it with meaning.  Unsure Ness of self is a wobbleness induced in what is being traced out with rings plus movement of story world thru those rings. Therefore it can be included with lots of other information. Wobble in cave wall during progression thru coronal rings of at maybe 5 Hz (drawn to greater 3d resolution high-f like 100 Hz) the higher Hz can fill in the tinier stuff like the tiniest stalactites on cave coronal ring ceiling. One "self" is looking at the movement of the the high-f stuff (gamma, phone screen for example), and another "self" is looking at rings of focus between physical but dimensionless world and spots of geometry on a cube.<br>
Color : which way vibrations on ring are oriented? Very tiny fast movements of ring, very high-f.<br>
Color may be represented by frequency of alteration between real and story world. Saggital and <br>
Could color be the feeling of Attitude change on ice cube representing ring and physical shape thereof - but how then could multiple colors be experienced at once?<br>
Conic angle thing last time means how close are you to asymptote out to the 90° perpendicular-to-plane of 2D ring whereby you may pass between, like corpus callosum, the real physical world and the storyworld, yes tethered a bit to physical world with anti-gravity up guidance.<br>
Maybe both and worlds are fired in temporally overlapping way in sobriety and hence the fooling blend, whereas high you can see the pfc (?) models rings and the ice cube of bank and the storyworld movement implied by definitions along ring of meaning (so three brain layers??) whereas parietal models 3d model shape of physical world and body SENSATION OF PHYSICAL WORLD MOSTLY VISUAL 3D SKIN OUTLINE. PFC IS MOTOR AND SHOWS VIA 2D RINGS ON IMAGES A STORY OF A PERSON MOVING THRU TIME!<br>
Is COLOR the ANGLE OF 3D MUD PILE OF ONE AREA RELATIVE TO THE NEXT? <br>
HIPP- 41,253 Orientation of spec on world1 and amplitude (?) ie distance out or just spot on ice cube axis with slight bend between this spot on ring and closest neighboring spots; orientation of spec (or whole ring) on world2 and qualitative info thereabout --> maybe hippocampus stores the angle between each or transformation mechanistic formula (or ring change relative to model of physical world anti gravity up [your body is just a modeled object within anti-gravity up physical world model, but the "eye" that PHZ "creates" via implication via size of geons used must match with reality of eye on that modeled body] and motor world anti gravity up change relative to ring)- to an epic cycle of a little duration of instantaneous 3d angle shift between the two worlds and the change of rings themselves in attitude and position and size and wave character. and info changes on spots on ring - this change in two realms both tied to ring And the meaning (back of shirt of dude) creates the sense of viewing it from the backside (creates the viewer) and the distance implied in that drawing there creates the distance between scene and viewer and that is how it casts that stuff outwards via a trick.<br>
Coronal (up down) and horizontal (right left) vibrations are colors; Saggital (in-out) is for white to dark (?). Is color how sunken you are between worlds?<br>
External world modeler creates a cube of sorts too with multiple 3d locations of air pocket or hand. It's like the scaffolding of the external world must come from backbone of ice cube 2d-attitude-selected selection. The rings are the spine support system for the 3d air-skin of physical world representation. Thrust provided from motion inherent in story as told by meaning interpretation of specific spot on ring and change from ring to ring thru time --> this thrust paints meaning via storyworld. It traces out a story like a hologram ring (Filler: ring or disc??) might with story moving thru rings. The intersection plane between worlds (like a neuronal bundle/black hole intersection) moves around too <br>
Maybe universe can't keep up with both dimensions x and y vibrations of light when you introduce a third z via propogation thru polarizing filter maybe it loses the info of exact angle of before filter light. In in-between sheets experiment. Anywho.<br>
Filler: Can there be a current focus of frequency? Note rings are being laid at multiple frequencies simultaneously, so is it possible the currently loudest one rises to being most notable, and usually (sober) it is the fast gamma rings, hence motor stuff is taken for granted and barely even perceived.<br>
Filler: remember you stared and stared at your home screen trying to see creation of color of various app launch buttons, with little success.<br>
The two worlds both represented (?) on ice cube (8/heatbeat now) like two broken pieces of magnet or like land mass going under, with plane of intersection between two dividing all 3d attitude angles in half. (Filler- THIS could explain what I mentioned earlier about you force cartoon world to model physical world rather than abstract thought when its attitude approximates the attitude of physical world model to its ring! I.e., there is a 2D ring which bissects between 2D physical world ring and 2D cartoon world ring! In other words, perhaps physical world ring is ALWAYS a coronal plane in front of eyes about 4-16"! But by coronal we mean based on feet location or toe point direction depending on whether you're lying down or standing.. Eh maybe not maybe it's just vantage point. Perhaps physical world needs anti-gravity up and the PREDOMINANT NET ORIENTATION ROTATION ABOUT ANTI-GRAVITY UP AXIS. Eh maybe not.. Perhaps it merely needs AXIS OF VANTAGE VIEW to determine ring/frame attitude perpendicular to it, but uses anti-gravity up and your layout relative to world (your orientation in world) in painting of meaning. I think this is correct. || perhaps side tilt flag is because when you close eyes you are no longer creating a physical world model and it's easier for cerebellum cause it has more PCs at that orientation?). A ring is happens to be the Geometrical shape of the intersection between the two worlds angle attitude view perspective.<br>
Color can be vibration in scaffolding of 3d world representation in three directions.<br>
Attitude and current ring draw have to be spread throughout whole brain so that so that cortex or layer 2,3 knows how to add on the sensory and prodigious info onto rings; also info on past and predicted or planned future rings to know current momentum vector at each point on ring. This must be content of or enabled in cortex via reticular formation modulatory waves (10 Hz, but variable?)<br>
Memory is similarity between rings same attitude, wave pattern, 3d wavy, amplitude, possibly frequency. You can progress down that other story a bit (different turn and carve out selection of dirt for cave). If you recall the ring with precise enough detail, it will feel as real as the original memory - this is what weed somehow enables.<br>
Filler: could there be an enslaved electron or something fundamental to universe that serves as source of spiral and twist to give rise to rings (could speeding and slowing or amplitude variation give rise to in and out of ring?)? Like how we enslave a quartz crystal to serve as fundamental basis of time and upon which the whole watch is built? (Filler: no. Too connected to physical world model)<br>
Filler: maybe boost plus chill gave you more 2Hz dissociation, but euphoria plus chill gives you enhancement of motor cartoon world ("rings," frames, bank). Would make sense - the higher thc hammer with no cbd would better hyperpolarize RSP. Introduce only thc (boost only) you get so disoriented from dissociation that it becomes difficult to maintain social credibility. If you introduce enough cbd, you don't dissociate much/any, can be socially cool if you want to, and apparently the combo is somehow good to cerebellum or hipp or cerebrum to give you rings. I really wonder what zen plus chill would do. Could that really unlock the rings and whatever underlies it??<br>
Does color use mini rings couplings between motor and sensory????<br>
Filler: foot with new black tennis shoe pressing gas pedal the slight engagement of opposite of gastronemius muscles was modeled in bank as a brand new image!!!<br>
Maybe memory is the series of connection angles along ring across a blip of time between physical and story worlds.<br>
Maybe weed speeds up attitude 3D angle change of surface of water over anti-gravity-in-physical-world-up up ice block, thereby triggering more thought more ideas to talk about more interesting memory fragments. Would dmt take this attitude 3d angle change to insane frequency, feeling that rings of focus went to 200 Hz or something crazy!<br>
Filler: anti-gravity up physical world model, foveal receptive field of view, retina, ring/plane attitude, direction of axis between retina and foveal field of view, head direction.<br>
Maybe hippocampus stores lots of connection data filtration/transformation computers (Filler: why computers? Why not just one transform between axis that applies to all spots? (?))<br>
Rings of Fire: The Intersectional Plane Bissecting Percepted Physical and Percepted Story World Focal Planes<br>
The physical world representation stays stable (transform needed from sensory inputs like coming to v1 - okay that you're not conscious of this confused state data - to get them to allocentric [world stable] state - then allocentric model of world built in a 3d scaffolding and a ring of focus comes upon part thereby focusing on it); the vantage view of motor cartoon (depicted in 3D via 2D rings plus ring-change over time) orbits in 3d attitudinal view angles (not stable). That's possibly the thing that moves around when you turn your head or PersonOne's vortex? You build scaffolding first at rings then ring change filling out.<br>
Filler: objects' orientation is just difference between their normal up anti gravity up and their actual attitude. Don't think it's such a hard thing.<br>
Maybe there is anisometry and that angle shift in crystals of 3d latticework why yellow is very close to white and can change a ton by time you get to deep orange and brown. And red is darker and hence has more range going into pinks and fuchsias. Or maybe it is degree of perpendicularity in that spot of 3d scaffolding degree of perpendicularity to ring/story movement thru rings. Horizontal movement right to left wouldn't hardly be seen along axis of a horizontal ring. In-to-center-of-circle-out---- movements could be something and movements parallel to axis of spinal cord of storyworldcomicbook could be another. I think black is a given backdrop - doesn't need representation and one thing gives amount of light (/white) and another the color?<br>
Or radially big retina and one spot coming and blowing up.<br>
Is color simply white (of varying brilliances) jiggled in up/down left/right or up down or upleft downright or downleft upright hex directions perpendicular to storyline axis. Or anisotropic funny angle. Is color just white with orientation line defined rather than being point? Via the jiggling? Or a time phased thing like parts of the wave? Or a time phased thing like two frequencies the beat between going up until octave reached then reddish again? Are colors more complex add ons of complex compositional frequency bands. Does color help orient/paint the bank for us for it to be stable to us? Default mode EC must lose gamma hence it can't draw the color unless more neurons enabled to fire fast (?).<br>
Bottom of cube can still have meaning of drawing a coronally viewed world. I suppose cube could be felt to be head crown up when lying on back, which would conflict with anti-gravity up. Maybe cube and selection can be perceived from multiple attitudinal viewpoints, making you deviate from having bank upright in your mind, but anti-gravity always clues you back in or head direction up.<br>
In general it felt like cube was aligned perfectly and solidly with anti-gravity up.<br>
<br>
<br>
Different neurons represent different angles - don't have to have 41,253, but you have lots - then something to show how far out on ring.<br>
Coronal sagittal and horizontal direction vibrations on ring possible, and maybe color is the link between <br>
<br>
Rings of Fire solves:<br>
Binding (unifying of all stimuli) problem (absolutely)<br>
Disparate Frequencies coming together <br>
Separateness of you from all else. (Maybe)<br>
<br>
Filler: you should try an afterimage while high. See what rings look like relative to it. Maybe even flag experiment. Dunno why you forgot that.<br>
<br>
Probably rate (frequency) of RF codes for part of ring, maybe the amplitude; hipp must do slow thinking focus waves cause you can still fast focus on math and visual stimuli after losing hipp just can't make memories of what focused upon at base level.<br>
<br>
Maybe RF OR HIPP or both provide rate of focal rings thereby creating a phase for inner creation of a circle of angles and size (amplitude) built upon that in some way and also attitude of ring like as against and upon ice cube built out. Maybe currently selected 3d pinwheels orientated in common attitude determine attitude and maybe even direction (CW, CCW) of drawing of ring. And maybe each segment of ring fires in phasic progression. And instantaneous high frequency/number of spikes within burst determines amplitude. Of course don't know that rest of brain has this pinwheel. But it would be cool with its tight spoke center and tiny neural fields there.<br>
<br>
There is the FEELING of purple in motor world (right hemisphere??), but also the visual purpleness of it in representation of physical world (left hemisphere??). Could this be merging of two worlds? But do you see this in real brain activity? Whereas you do see DMN and salience networks. I think DMN draws motor "internal" world (with help from pfc?) while salience network draws lattice of representation of physical world. I think you have to learn how to mentally draw cartoons before you have the DMN and do that as an assessment understanding tool of your whole activity (your story) and hence can interact with friends and change the cartoons you are drawing around different people- a million different people from one man to the next. No wonder kids and animals can't draw a cartoon of their existence nor tell their story cause they're learning building blocks the abcs of that language. Better visual acuity prolly leads to better drawing of cartoons. But these frames seem like 2D frames on ice block. You're drawing a cartoon and in essence jettisoning the past now 3d "frame/bankpaints". You learn to draw gamma aspects of a field of view via paying attention to small detail and differentiation in your visual lookings. Maybe cats don't have gamma or high enough gamma or high enough f of gamma? Or their eyes movements are uncooperative to that pursuit?<br>
There is meaning in cat world.<br>
Apparently you can start to paint color with phasic theta waves. Tho not good until high resolution of gamma makes it bright (amplified?) and plain as nose in face.<br>
Northeastfront vs southwestback purple v blue onion skins of purple, vortex but stationary, frozen.<br>
<br>
Filler : Lying on bed and twisting head to shoulder does change bank orientation; lying on side vs back does not <br>
<br>
Attitude/position/wave/size of ring determines how parietal cortex must describe it's filler (in representation of physical world) gamma info.<br>
PFC- representation of 2d+thrust+meaning of selection along ring of points in cartoon world - representation of motion and cartoonification of concepts hence we humans can navigate in abstract fields. I think pfc is linked with DMN and motor or premotor cortex but check. Inertia of movement of muscles of the reactions also to sensory and other (muscular incoming) inputs via creation of rings.<br>
PHZ- representation of 3d physical world, starting from ring, but with whole different orientation of modeled world. The modeled physical world is the thing anchored the thing which other is lightly tethered to like a balloon the cartoon world can rotate and move around violently. This (cartoon part) is the part that is man handled like spider, manhandling the world. When cartoon not dissociated from Physical world model, then all feels smooth and only arisement of integral whole meaning but mostly just physical world. When dissociated you more notice the changing plane of view of cartoon and see its 2d ring of creation and the thought motion it can depict such as when you imagine a person kicking a soccer ball. You see it in bits while dissociated like a patch of physical world meaning then a patch of 2d cartoon movement meaning, then a patch of physical world etc, whereas sober you get both at most all times.<br><br>
<br>
Freq isn't that important because gamma is writing rings as well as theta. What has to be preserved across brain is attitude and those other 2-3 aspects!!!! This solves binding problem!!!<br>
<br>
Filler now?: All I wanna do lyrics in Ariana into you song rings match in similarity with seeing words of title of Shelly crow song on app.<br>
<br>
Golden flake truck with image on back rings could model depth or as flat but confusing cause depth signals given so you see that first. Sober you give more credence to the fact that back of truck will be flat. Filler: something that provides high level filter checks is inhibited by thc. Maybe the pfc (middle frontal gyrus is definitely inhibited)?<br>
<br>
Could 10 Hz rf be providing ring info (the 4) across all brain, coming from pfc? Or coming from cerebellum better. Then a little of past and future.5s can be provided.<br>
<br>
Sound is represented by vibrations in rings (in placement of rings) I think in pfc or motor cortex why it feels inertial.<br>
<br>
Jewels face triggered remembrance of similar face of ____ Smith.<br>
Yea I guess detail of small depth change like face could be high gamma and somewhat difficult like 3d printing of it missing here and now hitting here etc like real 2d printer.<br>
<br>
  Could sound be vibrations in cartoon 2d rings and color be vibrations in 3d scaffolding representation of physical world?<br>
  <br>
The moon is as far as it is in the storybooks you read as a kid. The cartoon drawing giving the meaning of moon uses frames and those frames are based on when you first learneds about the moon hence the moon in those rings is the cartoon that's drawn, not a cartoon ring thing millions of miles out to actual moon, tho physical distance to moon is understood.<br>
<br>
How is scaffold built? Possibly by 3d rotation of ring spine causates hallucinates it as a matter of fact arising upon that scaffold like standing on water in skis.<br>
<br>
Filler: time lag of about 0.5 seconds - is prolly modeling prediction of future which corresponds with "right now" in physical universe. And 0.5 seconds of history kinda stay so sense of movement thru time. What's represented is movement along rings. Maybe it calls for it prior to it happening.<br>
<br>
"Can use a cilantro frame" to represent flavor taste smell may mean can LINK the current frame to that flavor which is represented elsewhere in brain say_____cortex.<br>
To "you" the sense of smells and sounds and like cartoonification draw of guitar and mouth voice and flute, and other felt qualia are understood in the 3d "dance" of this 2d or mostly 2d ring(s). Filler: Seems like smell is kinda hard to accurately and thoroughly imaginate maybe not as hard as color but harder than sound.<br>
<br>
Cartoon world is 3D world spun by spider, and traced and passed thru 2d (or mostly 2d?) rings; and which 2d (or mostly 2d) ring(s) model focal places (Filler: doesn't have to be focal places) in 3d scaffolding representation of physical world and depth on ring and attitude of viewer is created by what objects /relative-size used and other depth cues. And this ring is moving all over but slightly different shirt object scales and orientations are used. There are so many(!) scales and orientations stored!!! You can cleanly pass between attitudinal adjustments!! So many of 41,253 used!! It's like brain says "if I can model the hardest aspects of everything, then it will be very accurate and beautiful and flowing like a good graphics card or 3d rotating and moving camera.<br>
Focus on 3d scaffolding representation of physical world results in "true you" motion cartoon getting closer to modeling exactly same thing as it. You saw this as difference in "conic angle" last time.<br>
Geons are used in PHZ scaffolding model. Little piece of green pepper triangle extruded can be learned by looking, and as you move head right and angle left, you get parallax motion and differentiation in shape (multiple view orientations of it that can be used later). The difference in visual/shape relative to translation and rotation of head signal maps and has meaning that pops the whole thing to viewer plus viewed object as being the way the physical universe "must" be!<br>
Head/eye movement/rotation/inertial signals prolly are what stabilizes 3d scaffolding representation of physical world. Eye is just a canister within head. It can 3d rotate, head can 3d rotate, but it's the net 3d rotation and movement that matters and that gets tracked against. PHZ is very allocentric but with your body as the reference frame of stationaryness hence it is an allocentricity lightly tethered or anchored to retinalYOU the YOU (egocentrism) is created incidentall by objects used having meaning only as viewed from certain attitude and distance (allocentrism may have grid ie 6 hexagonal sides in horizontal directions); PFC/motor(/DMN?) is very 2d focus of storyworld -centric which also creates a "viewer" by meaning of things used in ring. This attitude can change (the up that is storyworldUP moves wildly compared to physical world model UP). Maybe vortex PersonOne saw is fast attitude change in certain cartoon.<br>
Do physical world model allo plus that-ego-centric make 90° conic angle, and cartoon conic angle to cartoon's "viewing retina" (which again pops out only via meaning of stuff in ring) makes variable angle but may be near 0° up to 90°? Angle changes more towards 90° as cartoon is forced to exactly emulate and draw exactly what physical universe model is saying to draw(?) when person focuses on explicit meaning or fine details of physical universe model.<br>
Maybe cerebellum enables longer holding of more precise cartoon and hence humans can abstract think and talk much more than animals.<br>
Tenancy in common is like polygamy or a hoe gf that you don't know she's a hoe. Joint Tenancy is like a foursome and as guys leave it goes from fractionated affection up to you getting 100% by right of survivorship.<br>
DMN you can imagine 2d outline of Becca talking and how she sounds but can't imagine DMN 3d image of face.<br>
With flag afterimage I bet you have a little gamma still going on in Vc even tho alpha in Vc is supposed to be stopping it. Because eyes not open, can't affix this "world" flag with vertical world clues, so it is easier to represent it rotated 30° CCW. It feels like that plane prolly cause it would just stay vertical (up would stay crown of head up), but anti gravity up is pulling axis of crown upwards about 30° to balance between the two. Lying on Back after sitting up looking at window window did rotate and moved laterally to right. Lying on Back looking at flag phone 40s then close eyes, you can make flag rotate about x axis thru phone upwards towards anti gravity up.<br>
You need 3d positional info of ring, you need vantage attitude and distance to ring from sensory world (model of physical world), you need vantage angle and distance to ring from cartoon motor world as well as movement vector and directional/speed change of said vector. That is all the info you need to build upon rings. Motor cartoon uses more planning to know how to model stuff and how it wants to attitude-rotate and otherwise change ring to create story. It may take a little advice from PFZ sensory physical section.<br>
So, layer 5,6 common to both regions -<br>
1. 3d positional info of ring (done via the bank and ebb and flow stuff below)<br>
2. Bank to sturdify the geometrical sense thereof <br>
3. Change in attitude of "water surface" (Filler: hell, water surface can dissipate and reappear elsewhere, and can make big shifts in attitude quickly)<br>
4. Change in level of "water surface" to force the use of different frames so same activity didn't get boring and so you keep learning from new vantage points the same basic stuff if need be. Prolly why memorization by repetition because each time you observe you build a frame at different properties and hence it's more likely you can get to one of the frames to explore a little temporal bit there as a memory. That the attitude of bank drifts might be possible in DMN but not in PHZ. Dunno that water surface is always changing.<br>
Cerebellum -<br>
1. May provide transforms of individual "pixel/voxel" which as you see can include half the vertical stalk of letter b at you looking a certain distance from screen. The inhibition provided back from cerebellum may encode angle to let pixel be at and possibly size needed to fit the distance or make arise the distance to viewer so called. FILLER: Maybe physical world model is GOOD and all you need transforms for it to make motor world on top of physical world model (yes your head direction has to be taken into account in said transform cause CARTOON WORLD is measured as "declension from" your head direction vector (and anti gravity up?) and translation therefrom. Ie what is the cartoon world vantage point vector to represent at any given point (all the same at any given instantaneous moment?) within and relative to the physical world model location. The reason the brain can easily imagine any huge distance is because it can SCALE DOWN the existing thought to use less bank. WHAT IF THE CEREBELLUM IS THE Straiate cortex FOR THE REST OF THE CEREBRUM?? To provide 3d orientations in every which way?<br>
2. Cerebellum has sideways and front on representations of your body (and prolly other bodies and other objects)- hence it is the perfect tool for creation of cartoon story motor world with sideways views of mouth speaking or mix of the two to slowly rotate or maybe there is even from above and below so that cerebellum can easily move rings and vantage of story, like I said with a little input from PFZ on what to include or how to change rings to model sonething. Maybe cerebellum teaches cortex how to craft story and once it learns it it's got all that down tho it needs help for new stuff if cerebellum removed.<br>
3. I wonder if cerebellum draws rings (plans future from past/"present"; provides error flagging to deviations between expected and found conditions either in sensory inputs or in position of limb) and then PFC and PHZ draw the two worlds and the two retinas. Like is cerebellum the powerhouse sun of the bank??? Don't the branches (purkinje) look like frames?? And geometrically those frames could be put together in a different-than-how-actually-laid-out way. Are there extensive connections between HIPP and cerebellum? Where a frame can be tied to a story in PFC or memory in PHZ? Or to both at once? And then you can go along that path of frames in cerebellum. There would basically be frames grouped into 3 to represent 3 axis directions. Or group them into 41,253 and represent ALL attitudinal angles with smooth transitions. Maybe that little thing on bottom of cerebellum does the up/down? Filler: does cerebellum operate on parallel fibers usually are firing in default state, and INHIBITION of parallel fiber gives rise to spot on ring? Hence why long term depression is chosen in cerebellum - depressing the depressing purkinje cell. No. Those are excitatory. /EndFiller. Cerebellum has head on representation of your body, plus view from left side, plus view from right side! What about top/bottom? What if the purkinje cells dendrite branches ARE the 2d plane of rings of fire? Maybe cerebellum is the thing that provides info needed to bind everything together via "current look, current ring"?? Mossy fibers could be motor cartoon input to trace of rings, and climbing fibers could be sensory physical world input? (Filler: unlikely. Maybe mossy fibers create rings or 3d physical world, and climbing fibers choose what to be conscious of?). (Filler: if you want to combine sensory plus motor, sensory is mossy from PHZ, and motor is mossy from PFC. I think there must be another circuit in cerebellum that links the two worlds together and handles the orientation shifts.) And where they meet together on a plane represents a spot to include within ring via Ltd? Comparison at deep nucleus of what motor wanted vs what it got and comparison of what sensory wanted and what it got. Maybe this comparison in deep cerebellar nuclei is location of generation of consciousness. Maybe there are tons of cell bodies in deep cerebellar nuclei and each represents a different plane thru bank so that in toto a whole representation of physical world can be made, a whole representation of motor cartoon world can be made, and there's even a ring of bissection which highlights and stores as memory via sequence of a few of such bissections and their ring change and attitude change. Then without cerebellum I suppose the person could carry on without consciousness using patterns in cortex and they would LOOK and SAY THEY WERE conscious!!!!! <br>
4. Maybe the branches are 2d ring/plane, but agglomeration of several at differring attitudes makes wavy 3d ring!<br>
PFC section needs -<br>
1. Vantage angle to cartoon traced by ring (possibly built in the context of "geons"- WHAT) <br>
2. Distance to said ring from that "eye" (built in context-WHAT)<br>
3. Movement of cartoon world thru ring direction (built in context - WHAT)<br>
4. That movement's change in speed or rotation (built in context - WHAT)<br>
5. Add sound and taste and mood and sense of self all that stuff that a 2d cartoon ring can draw and give by inertial feel of movement between Geometrical Constructs. (Happens incidentally but planned in)<br>
6. (A little past and future "reverberations")<br>
PHZ section needs -<br>
1. Vantage angle to physical world modeled <br>
2. Distance to said ring from the ego "eye"<br>
3. Keep track of head and within that the separately free eye 3d rotation(/translation) and net thereof.<br>
4. Building of a 3d lattice of physical world plus body representation, with body being reference of stationarity wrt movement and antigravity up being anchor, and possibly hexagon honeycomb grid holding world stable from spinning about anti gravity up vector.<br>
5. Add color <br>
<br>
It may be that thc inhibits simple spiking (50-150 Hz) and thereby incidentally increases the complex spikes of climbing fibers.<br>
Climbing fibers fire at low (but successful!) rates (0.5-2 Hz). "Long range SSs" may represent a form of 1 second "working memory". Each complex spike is followed by a 10ms lull in SSs.<br>
<br>
A circular perkinje branch add all the 3-D angles makes a sphere the a square Purkinje branch all directions would make a cube not sure what would make a broken glass. Probably a smaller funky Purkinje cell.<br>
<br>
Scratching my chin I used a frame (s) of ____ scratching his chin and his facial expression and then disliked associating myself with that lol. But you must see/imagine to do I suppose.<br>
<br>
The ring would also explain how you are conscious of self but not of others even when heads close together - your whole brain is putting into one ring(and two worlds two eyes); their whole brain is putting into a different ring(and their two worlds, two vantagepoints). <br>
<br>
Rings solve binding and exclusivity problems. That which arises upon rings is same universal soul tho.<br>
<br>
This could open up a well that could draw insane demand.<br>
<br>
Could orange and green be corollaries<br>
<br>
The wiggling of big toe went from front bottom of bank to back middle up of bank, with toe facing backwards and viewing bank with vantage point shifted left and hence rotated a bit.<br>
<br>
Once you figure it out, set up talks on it!!!<br>
<br>
Ring to unify needs attitude phase amplitude <br>
<br>
What if cerebellum handles motor cartoon world (2D Plus pull thru of past v future, sound) and also another region of cerebellum handles imagination of 3d models of like toe moving in bank over time? Then, cerebrum can handle "3d model of physical universe in actual size" as well as carrying out of motor and the filters of PFC and globus pallidus internal and subthalamic nuclei as well as head direction, eye direction, anti gravity up, STORY (but not cartoon style), and subconscious processing of and response to auditory (would a person be unconscious of sound, pain, cold, etc? Or is that modeled in cingulate and or insular cortex?)?<br>
<br>
It's possible bank stays anti gravity up (and ventral orientation grid layout fixed unless you move whole body direction) all the time, and moves in an arc to stay about (4-)16" away from your face.<br>
<br>

Rings of Fire: The Cerebellum's Contribution to Consciousness <br>

what is the important stuff is not the firing of a Purkinje cell but what goes on in the purkinje cell branches?<br>
<br>
Does PC/cerebellum ask, "is this within this plane and this time?" for cerebrum? And thereby help cerebrum (pfc/premotor) draw very accurate cartoon?<br>
<br>
Ie where is cartoon actually generated? Is it generated in cerebellum? Then lost if person lacks cerebellum?<br>
<br>
Note that you could make rough memory of cartoon.<br>
<br>
What if soundness is still given in cerebrum, but it's only the component of total sound less imagination of cartoon of _____'s voice "I know you can do that"? Such that cerebellum creates (or helps cerebrum to create) the AFFECTIVE aspect of all qualia?<br>
<br>
Have you noticed there are two stories? One the corkscrew jello story of RSP (a somewhat detached or sometimes a-willic observing of your story ie your existence/life) the other the (cerebellar?) cartoon pull thru story of current imagination focus (more of a you-experiencing being pulled thru and giving inertial aspect to your qualia [except color perhaps])? There's also the you of PFC (?) which isn't like a story but is more like the part of you doing your everyday life stuff like paying attention to chords on music and hitting proper bass note on bass guitar to correspond to that. This you is pretty tied in with PHZ visual/auditory flat assessment field.<br>
<br>
It's almost like the RSP is the ultimate summation of the cerebrum, but the cerebellum (or help from the cerebellum) provides the feeling of most(?) all the qualia. Does RSP lay down rings in same orientation and size and etc as other rings? I bet so!!! Tho with it being such a low f, and jello boxes being movified, there's not as much seeing or pop of rings relative to background inground contents. <br>
<br>
If rings thing is right, perhaps VC only ever creates 2d planar representations of 3d space, and makes multiple ("all 41,253 angles") planes of objects at same time (and especially with repeated fresh 3d moving encounters where more intermediary angles can be had (?)), with differing, but consistent, distances to each retinal pixel based on current planar slice attitude? The only "problem" with this is when rings (plane) goes very nearly sagittal or horizonal I'm not sure it handles shooting great detail out to left and right or up and down of plane all on one spot on ring? Seems like orientation of VC (v1) in calcarine sulcus and back of occipital lobe would provide basic horizontal and saggital orientations mostly, but also some coronal ones. Even the fovea of eye has all three orientations in V1 I think. AND remember there is both CW and CCW, as well as multiple slight variations off plane in the pinwheels of V1 straiate cortex.<br>
<br>
I remembered the hotel room by forward while driving the car is comparable to lie on back feet forward that I spent the most time forward in the hotel room i.e. on the one bed while awake not on the second bed while asleep nor the direction of entering the room. I can imagine the forward being different orientations though such as if I want to imagine walking through the front door I will see the hotel room with my forward that forward being aligned. while driving I can also remember lying on the bed and looking up and seeing the ceiling so that would be my forward while driving aligned with antigravity up in the bed and still TV facing my forward while driving. I can also rotate the hotel room in my imagination such that I forward while driving corresponds to laying on my right side then on my back then corresponds to laying on my left side. I can also imagine lying on my stomach such that I forward while driving equals gravity down. so I think by imagining these various orientations I am actually changing the attitude of my rings.<br>
<br>
Lying on bed you must pitch up; imagining it you must well it feels like anti gravity stays up and still you pitch up. Imaging turning tho eyes open you rotate cartoon imagined world. Real life you rotate you. Seems like you can still imagine yourself rotating in the cartoon (changing attitude of plane and/or vantage point). Pitching up or down.. SOOO! You can mentally rotate (yaw) the room and pitch it up or down and imagine it rolled to left or right, ORR you can imagine yourself rotating and translating thru it with room stable anti-gravity up and affixed to one position in its spin about that axis.<br>
<br>
Imagination wall would have to pitch up to be ceiling going from imagined lying down to imagined standing up via footend of bed. Hence you pitch up the cartoon representation of room. Then you yaw it. Rolling would spin the room in sagittal plane.<br>
<br>
Remember yea you see phone screen cartoon coming towards you, and presumably ring was edge of phone; but remember also that you saw ring at slightly different attitude relative to phone screen and it was almost like "paster" cartoon clips were used the further behind the ring the screen got, but in a very precise way so as to give a faithful rendering of screen.<br>
<br>
Let's say PC square branch has 100,000 connections (pixels)- that's 316x316 units. To make a cube you'd need 316 units in zed. <br>
<br>
Seems longer to read unknown text while rotating attitude of screen than while one single attitude.<br>
<br>
Again, it "isn't on the ring" if you're not currently paying attention to it (like sounds or whatever). May still be represented in 3d model of physical world (even noises may be).<br>
<br>
Imagining walking thru something is spider-handling the mental space to change attitude (mostly rotations about zed ie anti gravity up axis (“yaw”), tho you could pitch up/down or roll righttilt/lefttilt) and position (x, y, z translations, arc movements, accelerations, velocity); and objects used convey vantage point. Ie to rotate you must change distance to various points ie swap out models used.<br>
<br>
yeah yeah Brad and everyone changes from one moment to the next but you still have a cumulative life history and the somewhat of asymptotic approach met generally towards some filter percent of filters or set of filters<br>
<br>
consciousness is what reactions feel like<br>
<br>
Listening to the weight the band first little bit of guitar my brain used Papa Chuck frames plucking and then drums went over some Led Zeppelin sound so it’s kind of like using memory frames to paint with?<br>
<br>
Could joy and or motivation be associated with how long each particular frame is like when you get older and your memories wear out you see a shorter duration of each clip and less information, almost like it’s depressing being cut off from your happy roots. Getting older when I think of Papa Chuck‘s like several of the frames are not even related to him.<br>
<br>
For filters that you want<br>
<br>
For frames that you want to see such as 80s dad frames or 90s dad frames you can increase the sensitivity to that filter and you have so many filters and varying sensitivities on each one so that you can tune in to things that you want to move towards<br>
<br>
Could it be that a reason babies cry a lot and are happy and cool a lot is because your brain needs happy and sad frames to indicate pain or joy or lots of things in life?<br>
<br>
Could it be that phone screen frames are part of what makes the 2010s & 2020s feel horribly almost unbearably dry and soulless? (Filler: cause you are locked into a higher frequency, exact but unforgiving and unmerciful vantage, quite removed from your cartoon which can help you decide whether something is agreeable to you or not).<br>
<br>
What if enter rhino or whatever and amygdala smell goes to hippocampus, hippocampus determines which frames to use and tells cerebrum, and then cerebrum instantiates the frames and they come to 2d life in PC of cerebellum?<br>
<br>
Because it’s almost like the qualia at the taste of these toasty Cheez its it’s nothing but a bunch a very fast memory frames of eating them in the past and how it made me feel.<br>

V4 connections to cerebellum??<br>
<br>
Seriousness or sobriety that is violence that is calicing of the heart callous of the heart callous very callous Calais very callous of the heart it’s ignoring the inner conscience it is sin. it is the shearing off and killing of beauty.<br>
<br>
when we say that PFC or PHZ knows the constructs even if there is a lack of consciousness generated by cerebellum it doesn’t actually know it just responds in certain ways to certain inputs.<br>
<br>
Do cerebrum and cerebellum use EM radiation to communicate or something? To save time in sending back? What are antennas? Or is cerebellum antennas?<br>
<br>
If you were in a speck, would want to know time, be able to think, community or some way of fun occupation of time. Access to mic and camera would be nice. Smell and taste and touch not really needed.<br>
<br>
Prolly why people on shroom see lotsa eyes is because you have lots of them stored- it's the first place you look at someone or some animal.<br>

(FILLER: This is a couple days later, sober, just an observation. Much of the later notes within a trip note are added on days later in reflecting.) So while I was thinking about chair (if it was really glass or just the table, shape of chair) I drove past clinic turn. So my autopilot while keeping me safe didn't hold the destination in mind. Meaning focal rings may be necessary for going towards a goal? perhaps you have to imaginate the location and add it onto your 3-D world model and then navigate towards. Does this mean entorhinal cortex (or wherever place grid cells) stores bank or keys to bank stored in association cortex?<br>
<br>
120/76 bp<br>
<br>
Could the cerebellum be giving you consciousness while also acting as the final fine-tuner of precision, binding unification, f unification? Or does cerebrum still play a large role in consciousness, with cerebellum only providing motor consciousness or guidance?<br>
<br>
What still grinds my gears? I would like to identify exactly where and how rings are formed to a high degree of certainly, and also explain qualia creation and color creation in detail.<br>
<br>
Maybe try reading a physical book while high.<br>
<br>
All's fair in love and war means all is allowed in love and war but certainly not all is moral or beautiful in love and war.<br>
<br>
I mean maybe layer 5,6 or RF->matrix->cortex10Hz(not high f enough, so no) provide unifying attitude info, but rings in general I am not understanding how coronal rings (much less sagittal ones) can paint all 8,000 square degrees of view. Unless it builds it with that as the reference. I mean could attitude change be built into each single ring "to next ring" with higher f having finer, faster wobbles (radii of perpendicularity moving radial "axis") than lower f? Could all the frequencies communicate (via HIPP? via layer 5,6? via PFC?) with each other so that high frequency gamma-80 ring movement/change corresponds precisely with theta? How is attitude represented and communicated neurally? How are other deets of ring?<br>
<br>
Where is bank??! I mean you have place cells, grid cells, head "direction" cells in entorhinal cortex, but is that or HIPP just where transformations occur, or is that expressing the bank? Alzheimer's patients don't lose their ability to transform - they lose memories. Or does HIPP store IDs to frames in cerebellum? But those without cerebellum don't lose memory (it seems).<br>
<br>
You have to compare two pairs of vectors (or two singles of planes/frames) to relate one "direction" to another.<br>
<br>
World (model) has anti-gravity up and body feet direction (or torso direction rather?) seemingly. SEEMS LIKE A HORIZONTAL (TO GRAVITY) FIXED PLANE.<br>
<br>
Head direction could be reduced to coronal plane (close to visual field).<br>
<br>
Visual field can be reduced to coronal plane.<br>
<br>
Cartoon world is wherever, but perhaps more often it is Saggital?<br>
<br>
<br>
FILLER: MEC = Medial Entorhinal Cortex; LEC = Lateral Entorhinal Cortex; SPW = Sensory Physical World; CMW = Cartoon Motor World i.e. imagination/focus 10 Hz)<br>
Could MEC be source of SPW and LEC be source of CMW? <br>
<br>
Or MEC final step in where pathway and LEC final step in what pathway? Could it then generate color? <br>
<br>
You just had a frame of that acro pose where feet are in air touching other, hands on ground.  I think such frames last about 1/50 second but who knows could be 1/10 s or 1/80 s.<br>
<br>
EC (entorhinal cortex) has 6 layers (layer 6 may not have much).<br>
<br>
PersonTwo, when really high, sees hand movement afterimage. And yes he sees the rings or freeze frames.<br>
<br>
Absinth- wormwood- liquor store- can see like mushrooms<br>
<br>
Color prolly helps us see boundaries better - hence Lady's difficulty in seeing objects without movement.<br>
<br>
What if rings are pinhole cameras of em activity of neurons. What is protection screen? Skull?<br>
<br>
You can't make smooth pursuit eye movements unless there is something in field of view moving smoothly!<br>
<br>
Do you say you don't want to live when you're a newborn cause the person you will end up when old "isn't the same person" as when you're a kid? Of course not. Same with this.<br>
<br>
Ring attitude would have to be conveyed independent of base frequency, for base frequency seems to be used for frequency of rings. Does the attitude of apical stalk of special neuron represent that?<br>
<br>
Attitude of plane could be represented by declension in x and y from anti-gravity up axis. Those two components.<br>
<br>
Unsureness of self isn't just ~5Hz- it's LARGE patches of the cave wall/ceiling.<br>
<br>
What if HD cells->body direction; HD cells ->world direction; provide directions for how to read Vc visual stuff? Hence why you can learn to "right" any visual input (whether inversion goggles or what) and read that region of brain aright to make world up match wherever the up in visual field lies in cortex. Hence it would help babies at all if they began life with inversion goggles. Offset goggles are easier to adjust to, why?<br>
<br>
Ie, what if visual world is subservient to, and glued to, sense of body and body movement? Would make sense that body/body-movement would be FIRST represented, then visual and all else had to be added on.<br>
<br>
And perhaps smell would be added on to motor first? Or light?<br>
<br>
What if small things navigated with gravity first?<br>
<br>
What if cerebral cortex provides info of how to stimulate HIPP such that certain frames are thereby created?<br>
<br>
"Protoreptilian" -> Pons & medulla (nuclei) (includes basal ganglia(?) well all modern offspring have basal ganglia - doesn't sound like good argument to me) (includes otolith vestibular system!!!!!!!) 500 MYA <br>
"Paleomammalian" -> Allocortex (contains paleocortex [Olfactory Bulb, Olfactory Tubercle, and Piriform Cortex - 4 layers], archicortex [Hipp - 3 layers - oldest], and peripaleo/periarchi) HIPP & amygdala (& smell, right? Rhinocortex) ("limbic") 250 MYA<br>
"Neocortex" (& cerebellum??) -> Cerebrum 200 MYA<br>
<br>
Strictly speaking, archicortex has 3 layers, is the oldest, and is found in hippocampus but also some in the olfactory cortex.<br>
<br>
Do does it make sense for rings to originate with pons/medulla, hippocampus, or rhinocortex (olfactory tubercle)? Or cerebrum? <br>
<br>
Or could pons/medulla give rings, hipp and amyg be a means of remembering familiarity and making comparisons between rings, and cerebrum provide processing power to greatly enrich what can be written? And cerebellum can enhance timing and precision?<br>
<br>
Could hippocampus be origin of imaginator of extras hence alz lose not just memories but also ability to remember directions, locations, and orientation. Rear part of hippocampus larger in London cab drivers who imagine more and need more stored.<br>
<br>
I bet lgn/straiate amplify conicly the fovea. Cause otherwise it'd be a tiny area. The sense (or thereby, importance) is amplified but not in size.<br>
<br>
Perhaps why motor is drawn more when eyes closed is because cartoon world becomes prominent and 50 Hz in Vc is abolished.<br>
<br>
I would think phase within local field potential frequency would draw circle. But what would determine ATTITUDE of circle? Amplitude (number of spikes at one phasic location) could draw radius length at any given phasic point.<br>

Sober - Swept off feet felt like thrust forward at abdomen on bottom of a coronal ring, just like roller coaster hardness really was grabbing and thrusting you off platform.<br>
<br>
What makes something become consciously known vs unknown (most of cerebrum unknown)? Could it be that a steady frequency or even noise isn't conscious, but meaningful precession to the frequency is? Because it is somehow inertial?<br>
<br>
Could NOT be that first second third cycle represent x, y, z orientations both because rings stay in certain basic attitude awhile AND because you need to know about variations in a certain attitude immediately, and wasting three cycles would reduce spatial/temporal precision far below what is experienced.<br>
<br>
Could rings traced on body be used and rocked to some attitude relative to visual field and used as cartoon rings but also parallelly rocked to say coronal and used as visual fields rings?<br>
<br>
So that vestibular system (head direction)<br>
Transform -> body direction <br>
Transform -> world direction <br>
<br>
Then, body direction (selected slice ring)<br>
Transform -> cartoon ring direction <br>
Transform -> visual field ring/plane direction<br> 
<br>
Such that it uses inertia of actual body to paint meaning onto in multiple parallel ways and thereby define ATTITUDE of rings?????<br>
<br>
Mind blown again. Mind is blown daily.<br>
<br>
Could it use actual body and its inertia to give rise to spatial aspect of ring, and attitude, and inertia felt thereon? But it seems that rings could exist without body. Also, ring in mid air in front of screen, so no.<br>
<br>
Do you therefore lose lots of kid memories because you are taller? And frames become different?<br>
<br>
Do people that lose arms lose memories? Or if they don't lose memories, perhaps why they have phantom limb feeling at times is when those frames are used.<br>
<br>
The where pathway has no more info what-wise to you than it would have to a doorknob or to a worm.<br>
<br>
The what pathway it seems would need to instantiate memory frames to build meaning of what an object is. Perhaps why what pathway goes to HIPP prominently, and where simply ties in?<br>
<br>
Front door of r____ class oriented chest forward (not head turned to right forward) so when thinking of seeing a__, I'm turned sideways and see self from sideways view. But I can turn head to left and imagine the building front door being that orientation.<br>
<br>
Filler: now when I image r____ door, head on or rock that world such that I'm walking down sidewalk, my imagined feet are about at my nipple level, and outward from body maybe 8 inches, and whole scene is smaller.<br>
<br>
But body shape doesn't give rings (maybe torso does) unless you're just using relative from imagined origin at center of body and use amplitude to convey radius at each point, then you could draw a smoother circle altho it would be a ton of work. <br>
<br>
But you HAVE to draw whole body outline (whatever in visual field or eyes closed focus) anyway but it doesn't seem like that would comport with complexity of what things you need to draw as cartoon.<br>
<br>
HERE'S A THOUGHT!! You know how HD path from vestibular organs is bidirectional? Could it somehow use otoliths to attitudify the ring?<br>
<br>
Try spinning while high.<br>
<br>
Is the reason it is hard to think of horizontal ring, then coronal ring, then saggital ring because rings of focus must change, and that takes a moment? Why would it be difficult for brain to quickly change attitude thusly?<br>
<br>
Is the reason the vestibular fires continuously, and only increases or decreases because it serves dual function - to provide attitude specification as well as to orient head, then body & world?<br>
<br>

Fastigial nuclei send projections to all subdivisions of vestibular nuclear complex (superior, inferior, lateral, medial); semicircular canals send mostly to superior and medial; saccule and utricle send mostly to inferior; cerebellum (floccular nodular & medial?) some PCs send projections directly to lateral vestibular nuclei.<br>
<br>
Medial vestibular nucleus sends a projection to cervical ie neck movements via spinal cord or brain stem.<br>
<br>
Cerebellum at rest favors inhibition of intrinsic deep cerebellar nuclei via PCs.<br>

Part of the brain has to be devoted to producing consciousness, even if it is done via double duty.

Stupid.<br>

What if the body is the measuring stick and vestibular(+body?) is the orienting stick for building the model of the world + body? Something like that it uses the inertial movements of that to give skeleton backbone to firings?<br>
<br>
What if you could feel inertial stuff without a brain, but just can't know that you feel it? Or vice versa? Such that all inertial events are known but not felt without brain drawing cartoon thereof?<br>
<br>
Even mentally it's hard to change from yaw to roll to pitching an object.<br>
<br>
Outlines lag behind or have afterimage afterburn before colors would. It's like color is the highest frequency thing the brain does. It's like you'll have the outlines and the movement of the outlines before you have color. So that color never spills outside of lines. If there is any blur such as when you shake fingers as fast as possible, it's shades of opacity, not a messy blur.<br>

probably the reason why THC and possibly nicotine reduce the size of the hippocampus is because since they are blocking that temporarily it begins to somewhat atrophy. if so perhaps edibles would be worse for you than simply smoking hemp.<br>
<br>
you smelled cigarette smoke from car in front of you on 280 on way to acro. It triggered a memory from smelling cigarette smoke in the mall as a kid very pleasant memory memory. Why would it trigger it unless the ring shape was close to identical? And maybe not even the same attitude but then again maybe the same attitude? Could shape of ring encode something like that or shape over slight distance a little section of cave wall? It’s almost like it is not painting with the memory but rather it paints the shape of the thing smelled and then that shape takes you down the little rabbit trail that matches. so if there is a Jennifer Aniston neuron, then what if that neuron firing or the dendrite noise is actually painting a part of the current ring? I.e. in order to draw the Qualia sense of her. If so you know you could look there for where the brain is forming these rings.<br>
<br>
FILLER: I now understand this better. The smell of the cigarette smoke triggered that pleasant memory as a kid because there is an invisible, but functional, "skewer" going through a copy of the bank, and the "onion layers" are all possible memories to link to, and the PFC simply chooses to link with one and play the short video clip (~1/10th second) to help give meaning. The "ring shape" of smelling the cigarette on the road is probably irrelevant, and certainly not constant, for a series of rings can paint a whole 3D video scene which, passing through with flow, "feels" like the "smell" of cigarettes. The hippocampal area probably is in charge of linking all like things in experience together so as to be able to have memory recall.<br>
<br>
Could it be that the shape given for cigarette smell not only is that it is also used in multiple other ways for example maybe Morrow wall man Marlboro man on horse or with horse is also rocked around to some attitude so that the ring traces it out as well as many other things with that same or very close ring.<br>
<br>
also cigarettes always smell like cigarettes now the amplitude may be greater or less and some aspect of it may be slightly different but it’s still fundamentally smells like a cigarette. Why is that?<br>
<br>
FILLER: Let me take a stab at that now that I understand better. The "amplitude" of the smell can be painted into the story. More or higher vibrations while moving against flow can help paint it, as well as exaggerated disgust look of your face which CMW is painting. It simply has to be understood "how strong" the smell is, and the "feeling" is created. Even though smell doesn't go directly to thalamus like other senses, there are still pathways there, and smell is just another thing with meaning that can be added into the story, really no different than cold or touch or any other qualia.<br>
<br>
only thing is why would a word or how would a word like Christmas be shown on a ring? Does it just have like eight or nine different rings one for each letter? Or is it a single ring somehow?<br>
<br>
asbury United Methodist Church triggered memory before I could even read the words like probably by the time I was at about as...<br>
<br>
Bicep stand<br>
<br>
So this is difficult to put into words cause as soon as I realized it I forgot exactly what, but something close to this - change of angle of CMW relative to SPW encodes some meanings. Could thin vibrations in yaw, pitch, and roll between the two worlds (or between two CMWs?) provide 3 variables for creating of sense of colors? Like one black-to-white, one blue-to-yellow, one red-to-green? Or translational vibrations - in and out could be white, and the other directions up and down could be red-to-green, and right-to-left could be blue-to-yellow? Or maybe colors could be vibrations in SPW?<br>
<br>
Could colors be made by changing in complex (with varying degrees of included overtones) ways thru blackish and whitish frames?<br>
<br>
Why would a certain proportion of thc to cbd lead to creation of happy frames? Ie happiness written into rings. And why are only some (fairly few?) neurons conscious? Does this indicate that rings are drawn somewhere near that location (whether in dendrites or in synapse or even in pre-synaptic neuron's terminal of axon)? Or just that we then feel an influence on rate or timing of post-synaptic action potentials.<br>
<br>
What if the whole of meaning is built upon patterns plus movement of head?<br>
<br>
What if the "same consciousness" is that one consciousness of universe is reading every bit of matter, but with humans and animals, there is neural activity representing things and it reads that?<br>
<br>
<br>
PFC - draws rings (or does HIPP?)<br>
PMC - draws corkscrew (corkscrew because ring has changed in 3rd D over the course of time duration of 1/4 second- creating thread)<br>
Both PFC and PMC use bank (layers 2,3 or 5 and/or 6)<br>
HIPP - provides attitude and other ring dimension info (or does RF?)<br>
PHZ - draws 3d outlines of world and your body and therefore "your gaze" and HD and anti-gravity up all that can be calculated therefrom<br>
<br>
Sleep (Stage 3,4 esp) - delta of PMC still goes but without "Brad"<br>
<br>
Why are we not usually conscious of rings? Cause it isn't included in final product? Cause they're used to construct qualia sense and response thereto but focus is attracted to SPW model?<br>
<br>
Is vestibular or cerebellum used in anything of note? (HD stuff doesn't count).(<br>
<br>
Does PHZ time the firing or precessing of certain of its neurons such that they fire when the ring would select them, but it's actually backwards, such that by PHZ firing at certain times, it is defining the ring and its attitudinal rotations and other morphings over time? Does the PFC (and cerebellum?) help tell it where ring should be so as to tell the PFC's story within that same ring?<br>
<br>
Or better yet, is ring together determined first, then both sides get to work painting their version of what ring should be modeling (and what attitude it should be relative to each other and to their worlds?)? In this way, ring could be always strictly 2D with no attitude, and only radial distance out, which seemingly could be done with nothing more than a baseline frequency and cells to draw out amplitude at phases. <br>
<br>
Then, pertinent PHZ neurons at spots on relational matrix/lattice would precess/fire to/at just the right times if they together wanted a +10° y-axis rotation, +90° x-axis rotation attitude for circle. At the same time, pertinent PFC neurons could fire to represent a +90° z-axis rotation and somehow fill in meaning (selection/meaning) and velocity in that world model.<br>
<br>
In this way two signals from RF could form ring, and PHZ and PFC could provide attitude from flat to the attitude they want ring in each of their worlds. I don't see how you could have 3 rings in this model.<br>
<br>
Here's a thot - maybe SPW doesn't need a ring, but it's anti-gravity up ground plane is the flat of plain ring (or maybe coronal is the ring flat), and PHZ does some of CMW's work by allowing posts of its scaffold to precess and paint an attitude for ring for CMW, which attitude is useful to it for whatever reason (take your mind off text for a moment or whatever). Then, PFC still has to say what angle its world is relative to this ring. Plus, if flat starting point is defined as coronal, then angle of ring relative to this already defines some rock or degree of floating of CMW above SPW. Maybe I should call SPW VPW (Visual Physical World) sense CMW handles most of the qualia senses. Another advantage to defining flat as coronal is that that is eye1. Then, eye2 of CMW can bounce around like a speaker vibration but a 3D vibration. What if ring within SPW (or just call this Sighted Physical World) is unimportant and hence not worried with being drawn?<br>
<br>
So the cartoon eye2 is just that - an eye2 - it isn't your principal eye dissociating. It's just creating a sagittal scene with reference point of view off to right side. What cartoon is trying to convey is important thing, not so much how much you may or may not feel the eye2 being offset.<br>

Or is coronal plane glued to anti-gravity up and feet forward direction, so that you can move eyes and head a little.. No. It's like SPW is a hard model of world and of your body and eye1 is part of model. Allocentric. Head can rotate and cartoon holds steady; if head translates then cartoon moves with.<br>
<br>
When breath taken away, you could say CMW matched SPW and that top of ring was the hinge and bottom swung out in front of you, pitching up? So does degree of dampening ("hinging") help encode?<br>
<br>
If you're sagittal, what is pitching? Looks like roll huh? If you're horizontal, roll looks like yaw to normal upright person with frontoparallel coronal plane.<br>
<br>
So, eye1 and eye2 vectors can come closer or father apart, but eye1 moves independently of physical world model. Kinda like the sun-catcher creates a focus point that is an "eye" since stuff sent it there. There is a part of you that is allocentric. This part of you knows locations and can imaginate how to get to clinic because it builds model of whole world of trek in faint detail. <br>

Possibly lower f rings have more of 3rd dimension to them and more thread.<br>
<br>
What things aren't in SPW model? Sense of sound, heat/cold, pain, feelings, inertia (say due to gravity or whole house or elevator lifting up with no visual cues), smells, tastes, sense of vibrations on skin not in field of view, sense of self. Hence these are represented in PFC and anterior cingulate cortex (and amygdala?) as a cartoon motor world. <br>
<br>
What things are in SPW model? HD stuff, allocentric stuff, proprioception stuff, location of sound (whether in visual field or imagined added 3d map), location of touch, location of inertial stuff like opening of elbow, movement (locations) of body or objects thru model.<br>
<br>
Locations of qualia, if they have a location in model of physical world, are shown on SPW model. The sense of the qualia are shown thru complex vibrations of ring in CMW model.<br>
<br>
Perhaps you can only experience the qualia of one color at a time (only what you are focusing on at any given split moment). If so, maybe color feeling is still given in rings.<br>
<br>
"Whatness" of an object seems to only be able to focus one at a time, and is an associational thing (paint by memory to mouthing of word, look of word imagined spatially, purpose of thing, maybe thing in motion in CMW, etc.). Can "whatify" a whole ensemble - "ceiling fan" - or tiny components - "filament in light in ceiling fan." 3D outlines from bank may help in linking what scale you want to go to. You can move around in this semantic and 3D outline and mouthing and see letters of word and hear sense of sound of word thing as you like or as PFC likes.<br>
<br>
Can one frequency vibrate rings independently of another? Say, unsureness of self as 5 Hz wobble in cave wall not messing things up at 40 Hz cause that's drawing something else? Or do they have interference as you'd expect? Or are both possible, in the sense of lower frequencies have a different thread and hence don't overtly bother the higher frequencies, having only spots of messing?<br>
<br>
When you lock your eyes and focus on say one letter B of Blackstar on amp, you're immediately dropping any focus on rings.<br>

What if PHZ somehow paints visual 3d on cave wall? So that rings and cave wall is all that is generated?<br>
<br>
So, you have allocentric SPW model, eye1, eye2 which can rock around and which may or may not closely model SPW. AGU (anti-gravity up) is generally the up for both SPW and CMW, tho less for CMW. The rings and story viewed "by eye2" provide qualia of percepts, tho eye1 doesn't have to be focusing on it.<br>
<br>
So, eye1 is the physical eye(s) (the "I," the body, the you at the forefront with the world), and eye2 is the mental eye (the "i," the "true self," the "deepest soul").<br>
<br>
So, eye1 is just a camera angle in allocentric world model.<br>

Do cave walls somehow produce visual field?!?<br>
<br>
If you start with motor only (1 Hz), then add a light sensor and increment excitatory synapse (bump to 1.5 Hz) for field ON or decrement ie inhibitory synapse (lessen to 0.5 Hz) for field OFF, that would make sense of first processing steps of retina even once it got a lens. Brightness would come to be associated with increased movement forwards or towards stimulus, and darkness would be decreased movement flagellation towards lack of stimulus. Or if you start with inhibition, then you want to fire (thereby inhibit flagellation) when no stimulus coming in, and restrain (thereby allow flagellation) when light coming in. Light coming in inhibits the inhibitor; lack of light allows inhibitor to inhibit thereby slowing progression in that bad direction. Also why would you want to flagellate when it's dark and you wanna sleep? So for retina cell to fire in darkness and have inhibitory synapses on post synaptic motor cells makes sense as first step. So maybe light came to be associated with allowing motor movement and darkness with inhibition down to nothingness and stillness. <br>
<br>
Well, how much it pushes it out (colored story- past coming towards you future away but coming into focus) could make the mud contours you spoke of. This (slope) would seem to be transitions in brightness. Directionality would be forced via spatial relations, but a skewer thrust could maybe define color. Altho I don't think I noticed that. Unless you only focus on one color at a time, and whichever one you focus is the thrust of the entire traceout in that direction.<br>
<br>
Think evolutionarily - tension (touch) from bacteria swelling. Might touch and sound impact size of ring? In fact sound and heartbeat do seem to be shown as vibrations in size of ring. <br>
Unsureness of self as 5 Hz flop in section of cave wall means the organism is not solid and is too unduly influenced by outside forces.<br>
But 5 Hz sound nm 5 Hz is below audible. 5 Hz unsureness may be tied to unsureness to give unsureness feel.<br>
Past thru future is a movement hence shown as the pull thru of story.<br>
<br>
It may be the 2D ring can model stuff inward or outward and thereby by what is defined have a 3D squiggle sense. Like the coronal ring at chewacla could have modeled POSTERIOR part of head by coming inwards and then defining a POSTERIOR part of body.<br>
<br>
Could cold be modeled by a flat motionless horizontal plane, and dark by a flat coronal plane??<br>
<br>
So the first bacteria sense chemicals “taste" and later stretch (bad) and light. But taste and light govern movement, whereas stretch governs body adjustment (keep water out!)<br>

Sorta like a split screen - you can pick whether to focus on egocentric or ringcentric camera view. <br>
<br>
You usually don't focus on allocentric object unless you spatially dissociate from egocentric camera.<br>
<br>
If you get high again - color & rings. Need more info on how exactly rings give rise to specific qualia. And does you feel localized (EYES CLOSED) to right anterior insular cortex?<br>
<br>
Could your first time have set you in PFC (rings 3-10 Hz), the 2nd time set you in PHZ (10-20 Hz with a bit of sensing movement of world?), the 3rd time set you some in PMC (corkscrews 2-4 Hz), the 4th time set you in PFC + PHZ (10-20 Hz), and the 5th time set you in PFC + PHZ (10-20 Hz, some 40 Hz)? If so, dissociation can be to blame for all of those.<br>

Could it be that brightness of phone screen is what makes it come towards you? Like the amoeba swam towards light so brain just default represents light as coming towards you?<br>
<br>
So I made a mental (coronal) map of where Big Mikes Steakhouse was when seeing on Google maps in phone screen (head looking down at phone hence horizontal there), and when I was at coffee shop and the split second to plan for going the approx half way and the coronal version of map provided me with ability to have what I needed for matching up plus that gas station the Spencer one the circle K one. I wonder if a layer of cortex (or just the cerebellum) provides 3d attitudinal transforms of any object, or if it's even necessary if you're just comparing the content between two things at differring attitudes.<br>
<br>
Three separate movements of rings - (1) past, present, future; (2) what is modeled changes without ring moving (knee then shin modeled with same spot on ring hence body has moved); (3) ring can move and change shape and attitude.<br>

A brilliant (but not in light, nor in hue, nor in saturation) cyan- I've never seen, but saw in mind's eye. Brilliant in its cyan feeling but in a visual way. Aqua but without green. Not really straight blue tho either. And not half way between.<br>
<br>
Is matter a pairing of source and drain, and the source repels itself so would go crazy except for stabilization of drain which has gravity and therefore there is this 3D wobble that depending on ratio of source to sink may be very pointed (& therefore pointable ie polarity or something) or very wobbly and at some point spins and then beyond that if it is even more wobbly it becomes unstable in spin and hence is flipping at varying rates and with super high rate the wobble flip has very high frequency but also as it is not stable therefore it doesn't appear to flip but rather to be always slightly flipping ie 3d attitude changing.<br>
<br>
The mafia is the biggest threat right now - that is the status quo - the public opinion that can run over uniqueness and nuance and not even realize what it killed.<br>
<br>
What if it has to spin at super high rate to prevent source material from falling immediately into drain? At high enough spin, source is able to release its material via creation of space which is anti gravity.<br>
<br>
Can call it source and sink. But sink like sinking in not like a sink faucet.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the wobble of SINK provides thermal vibrational energy to stuff because it changes the direction of where to be net attracted to in a very complex way.<br>

<br>
Does a magnet have stability because it is a pairing of two such sets married at 180°? And same ratios of two underlying source/sinks to have "polarity" in first place?<br>
<br>
As source spins, could some effluent escape the black hole of sink, and most be attracted and stay in orbit, and look like hard matter to us, but it only be the black hole sink keeping it there and if it weren't for the black hole sink, the "matter" would evaporate out at light speed?<br>
<br>
There's momentum and an oscillating cycle between space (repulsion, heat) and counterspace (being sucked into cult of sink and pressed into latent heat).<br>
<br>
Is there a homeostasis of ether or this effluence and it does attract itself when it is stretched out and rare but when you compress it it repels itself?<br>
<br>
Maybe the effluence (ether? And radiations of it are gravity?) typically is passed around at quite sub luminal speeds, but only vibrational fast perturbations are passed along at light speed, comparable to sound and air molecules.<br>
<br>
What if the quasar is the electron and that is why it appears to have no mass (effluent all shot away at very high but sub luminal speeds) and why it has spin.<br>
<br>
Could intersection points between firing neurons paint rings?<br>

Sound comes at a certain speed but it's all in the moment. Crossing the creek your body motion speed determines how much moment you get to decide each step then it's gone cause you're moved past.<br>
<br>
How do you program it into something felt (inertial?)(and how to feel spatial locations?) because all the stuff brain is trying to represent if you had to process it logically at the end you'd be on to the next set of info before you got anywhere with cracking the first set.<br>
<br>
What if time is spinning about counterspatial point which is shared by all locations such that time is spinning not just straight forward thus giving rings of fire? But I think not as you can change your rings at will at times?<br>
<br>
So that electrical compressions and rarefactions in time can also have a spiral polarization (like light) which looks like rings at high frequency? (Looks like a spiral corkscrew at 2 Hz; looks like rings at 5-40 Hz). But how would neurons produce laser like phase coherence and direction (attitude)? Like how could they all be shooting EM in a single direction? Or is there a part of brain which filters out all but a certain direction? Or is there something that, like a laser(?), inhibits all but one direction? Does GABA or PFC do that? I don't think cerebellum would do that as it is psychedelics, not cerebellum loss, that leads to inhibition of the inhibitor (?!) and hence maybe seeing all directions at once - blurring to universal oneness. Of course we're talking (0.0001?) 2-200 (20,000?) Hz EM waves.<br>
<br>
The waves don't seem to go on forever (but who knows) but rather seem to cease about as soon as they are made, except that with erb you may continue to see 20 past rings. Why would the propagation last longer in that case? More dendrite firing about prior to launch? But it seems launch happens immediately and then those are afterburn, like continuing to make em signals that always are fading away almost immediately but by continuing to create it looks like they lasted longer (rather than assuming thc acts to help signal to propagate further into space before disintegrating - if any spatial connection there, imagine how far you'd be at light speed at 0.5 seconds??).<br>
<br>
Amplitude of EM could serve as producing length of instantaneous radius.<br>
<br>
Maybe brainstem with its mildly fluctuating signals is determining or communicating current attitude and shape (and location?). What determines clockwise vs counterclockwise? Or is it always one way? But seemingly not as 3d attitude rotation could change it.<br>
<br>
Honestly, you need minimum of 20,000 Hz for sound. Some animals may need higher such as greater wax moth apparently needs 300,000 Hz unless he shifts it down.<br>
<br>
I mean cerebellum parallel fibers and then 90° purkinje if they were 90° out of phase could produce circular polarization, but way to fast a rate, right? Could you get it as slow as 0.125 seconds phase lag as needed to produce the fundamental corkscrew which is 2 Hz? Highest frequencies in humans would need 20,000 Hz or 0.0125 millisecond (0.0000125 second) lag precision. And I mean phase lag precision between parallel fibers and purkinje cells, for example. You'd need 1 to 1/10,000th decisecond precision (1/10th to 1/100,000th second) in phase lag and corresponding signal duration (1/2 second to 1/20th millisecond).<br>

Rings of Fire: The EM Waves of Consciousness<br>

Rings of Fire: Cerebellar, Circularly-Polarized EM Waves of Consciousness  NO! PHZs <br>
<br>
Only thing with this whole line of thot is, that spiral em trace isn't really spatial - it's magnitudinal. Almost like you need to go back to change in direction 90° from parallel fibers to purkinje cells the SPATIAL LAYOUT of this ring here being what provides circle (and therefore "phase" underlying circle). But then there are pcells with differing attitude so I guess jeez I really dunno.<br>
<br>
Why should I guilt trip myself because a sometimes bad gov has a lot of debt? Us debt. No reason to feel guilty. I didn't want them in charge, didn't want them getting a lot of debt. Why in the world would I feel guilty if they did something I never wanted them to do in the first place? Why do people think they need to hurt their own psyche because of strangers' actions?<br>
<br>
What if what binds mental together is the attitude (and shape) of ring, and freq can do its own thing?<br>
<br>
The slower you get (down towards 2 Hz), the more it looks like a 3d squiggly ring rather than 2d. Higher freq, it looks like straight 2d.<br>
<br>
Remember the ring isn't a line - it's a guide or tracer for where.<br>
<br>
When you start and stop the corkscrew, the afterimage box is created in great relief giving rise to very boxy, very Fourier (as opposed to sinusoidal) corners.<br>
<br>
So that radio waves could be feeling themselves but non-sensical as we didn't build any meaning into the rings and spirals thereof.<br>
<br>
So this article on PHZs is really good - https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05097-x <br>
<br>
It makes a very good case (by Christopher Koch) that consciousness is generated in posterior hot zones. When you stimulate this area you produce all conscious qualia. When you eliminate it, you lose all conscious qualia and even space, color, shape, etc. When you stimulate PFC, nothing. When you remove PFC, may lose inhibitions and hence turn into a social monster, but don't lose consciousness. Can lose parts or all of cerebellum without reporting any loss of qualia (!), and same with neck level spinal cord severance (quadraplegic, but still having all the qualia). Know thou that thou canst also lose half your cerebellum (like left or right half) at say age 4 and have enough plasticity to be okay and normal mostly. <br>
<br>
Maybe PFC is your "search by" and "filter" region. Could still be cerebellum used to instantiate consciousness - ppl could just report as a robot that they still have qualia cause underlying brain still has the info even tho no one is home.<br> 
<br>
Maybe what you experienced wasn't PFC vs PHZ but rather PHZ with and without pfc input making it at certain brief blips. A blip in PHZ could then look like a freeze frame(?).<br>
<br>
Connections in PFC (esp extreme PFC) more random access memory; connections in PHZ more like a grid of pyramids.q<br>
<br>
Only stimulating the right side of (fusiform gyrus?) results in hallucinating of a face.<br>
<br>
So if rings of fire (and background 3d outline stuff is connected on rings? and memories???) are generated in PHZ, then let's get looking there!<br>
<br>
Still, how does brain do spatial? Does layer 2,3 going to layer 5 pyramidal give the 90° shift and does it also use a 90° phase shift so that a neuron creates rings via circular polarization? Still not sure that would give a FEELING of space, but maybe at least it would provide attitude (?).<br>
<br>
Hipp-> apparently CA3 is where you find memory from partial match that triggers & DG is where you determine whether stimuli is novel or known. <br>
<br>
Also Hipp-> DG & CA3 neurons that encode upon a fearful memory are active upon recall of said fearful memory and silencing of these cells precludes remembrance of fearful memory.<br>
<br>
Cornu Ammonis ("Ram's Horn")-> CA1, CA2, CA3, CA4 -> pyramidal cells, hippocampus proper<br>
<br>
Dentate gyrus (shaped like a tooth)-> DG -> granule cells<br>
<br>
Subiculum is contiguous with CA regions (CA1)<br>
<br>
Entorhinal cortex is next to (under) Subiculum. All info going to hipp enters thru entorhinal. Then, EC projects mostly (perforant tract because it perforates the subiculum) to DG, but some to CA3 & CA1. DG then projects ("mossy fibers") to spiny dendrites on CA3. Many recurrent (use output from self to inform input to self) connections within CA3. Then, CA3 projects ("Schaffer collaterals") to CA1. Then, CA1 projects to subiculum, and subiculum projects to entorhinal cortex, completing a loop!<br>
<br>
DG may be pattern separator so that you don't recall too many overlapping memories. By inhibiting this via weed you could actually boost memory linkage!<br>
<br>
Could DG simply take 2D slice or ring of 3d input data from cerebrum? This 2D slice at some chance attitude would trigger memory completion if it's been important enough to you and if sleep or study has said so by re-examining it at all 41,253 attitudes. Or perhaps by putting into 2D, attitude needn't matter (then attitude would have to be encoded at say cerebrum).<br>
<br>
Again, could vestibular system provide the attitude? What would provide the spatial distance tho?<br>
<br>
Attitude could be repped by:<br>
*Phase 90° + phys 90° cerebrum -> circular polarization <br>
*Vestibular system<br>
*Pinwheels<br>
*Planar selection slices thru CA1 bank<br>
*Use of bit of physical body neurons to rep<br>
*Some neural code?<br>
*Multiple things all going off same ring as reference? Sounds pretty promising - like body says here's body relative to it; visual says here's visual relative to it; motor rep says here's my cartoon world drawn from it; smell says I'm using this particular ring that is this smell (??!) (dunno cause sudden smell would be huge attitudinal or shape change - maybe just use part of ring, or maybe smell is a separate shape ring??). Could motor cortex (or smell) provide ring shape after planning and hand to PHZ for conscious knowing and building upon?<br>
<br>
What do PHZ neurons do differently to create consciousness?<br>
<br>
Remembering ________ reroof job at the split moment I needed it (but couldn't remember earlier when I tried) it was almost like I had the FRAME in memory - the ID - (and maybe a little of first letters) and knew I needn't worry cause I had all of it by having that and could pull it up in Bizzy Books.<br>
<br>
Today watched two good videos on hipp and then a really really good one on fly visual direction preference detecting neural mechanism<br>
<br>
How do you know this stuff?? I can't tell you cause it would piss you off.<br>
<br>
What if the world is so off from what brain is creating that that's why we can't figure the space stuff out. What if there isn't any space in the physical universe and instead it is all concepts and data and even the brain is not spheric but rather flat or point-like? Or what if circles of planes don't translate to reality like up down is as far removed from right left as up is from down? And right left isn't really inbetween the two?<br>
<br>
Like a water molecule.<br>
<br>
I think binding info must be passed thru aarf - I mean cerebellum or nuclei could be but one loses cerebellum without fanfare. Or binding could be passed from pfc thru cortico-cortico fibers. Or it could just be determined in PHZ altho I kinda doubt that.<br>
<br>
Prelim theory - rings used to bind, drawn in PHZ. Ring shapes stored in hippocampus (or EC) (or just in cerebrum with hipp serving as address book and comparator). Rings have a definite attitude (vector) which changes usually pretty slowly, but also can fade out and start over at new attitude. Solves binding, frequency, uniqueness, and qualia problems.<br>
