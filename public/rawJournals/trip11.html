<h1>Raw Journals: 11/11/22</h1>

<p>The following are notes from 11/11/22 (taking a couple puffs on legal hemp vapes) and extra filler added later in contemplation. The reason there are typos is because I swiped it all out with my finger on my iPhone as quickly as I could and didn't want to lose thoughts by going back when iPhone keyboard was being stupid. Some of the things I can no longer tell exactly what word I was going for, so I'm leaving the text alone. I think the most philosophical thought can be gotten from it that way. I add filler here and there to help provide context/meaning. These notes should be taken in a philosophical way - I write everything down that comes to mind without checking it; then I can check and consider the things later. Thus, statements that appear as fact may be me looking at something a certain way and trying it on, but it doesn't mean that I fully agree with it. These notes are more like grasping to try to understand consciousness and just things in general.<br>

Rings could reiterate owl face sheet so seemed to hold in place as focusing on features as a whole.<br>
Rings ceasing walk (deceleration) can draw attention (owl face, looking down at phone "impact"). Another example, a person walking to edge of diving board- just at end, the ring's (skin's) walk scrunches to a halt and inertia might not be stopped gives sense of scare. <br>

<br>
Everything is there perceptually, but there is a ring draw that has some current looking at quality. Brad can be looking elsewhere and hence it is IN THE STORY (that already perceptually exists without the rings), but focus on rings drawing the leading future edge of this dont even touch Brad and his gaze. Current Ring can go back to a paster spot spatially to correct.<br>

Color is if there's color. Rings paint coloration into story if eyes see color, and in dreams! Maybe able in dreams cause imagination gets where pathway.<br>

Maybe sober brain inhibits brightness of ring (cerebellum return path) and/or effusion is less inhibited so refresh carries everywhere.<br>

As I am driven down road, there's a little walk of rings relative to Past ring but only about 1' not 200'! Change of scenery shows other 199'. Also, car getting further ahead skin on front of car stretches more ahead of my car front skin every ring - no backs - that way, can have ring "plane" sheet, even if quite bent!<br>

What if there is fundamentally only one shell of bank (one cube, one sphere, one broken glass, one copy of other prominent things), and what I call the bank, with many concentric layers, is actually made easily by several copies of the one thing, and these many concentric layers are for judging size at distances?<br>

Your motor is the viewer : the thing that controls all the levers looks at the story and decides accordingly, often believing he is the character in that image.<br>
<br>
FEF controls moving eyes (EO) to a place of  interest in real world (and thereby eyes (&view) will be moved in SPW); anterior right insula apparently shifts between looking at CMW and SPW.<br>
<br>
Maybe bank is more concentrated in 2' cube in front of face since you spend a lot of time looking there (phone).<br>
<br>
Since the space of preception isn't real physical space, it needn't worry about anything besides making the meaning of it.<br>
<br>
PFC can consider from the vantage point of the "physical" eye, but can also consider from mind's eye perspective of either modeled SPW or "straight" CMW. Can also look upon skewers of meaning ie commonalities memories.<br>
<br>
Consciousness is the story sensory cortex tells (thalamus?); pfc can suggest action stories. Thalamus (or basal ganglia?) can decide which to act upon. Perhaps pfc even shows thalamus logic, efficiency, and ethical imagery to steer direction.<br>
<br>
Is the "you" the freaking cor-thal "resonant circuit"???<br>
<br>
"Lemniscal" inputs (eye, etc) are only 5% of inputs to thalamus. Cortex can't speak any language but thalameese. About 40% of the input to the thalamo-cortical neuron comes from the cortex!<br>

The bank (at least the spheres) derives from the RETINA's activity, both the concentric spheric shells of ray trace length as a fact of geometry of condensing 3d reality "viewed" from some location into a "2d" shell, and the spheric rotation saccades. Rotating eye up is same as rotating world down. The image on retina as you move around changes, but the concentric shell 3d world it is collapsing into a single 2d shell stays the same. The meaning - the sizes and relations of things in that 3d world - stays the same. And since the brain uses the bank to convert the 2d shell back to a 3d world (placed on concentric shells), as you move head to left and reduce distance between window and left wall, the ray trace from both voxel points now collapses onto a single pixel point. That is just geometry. HENCE, the 3d world repped thru brain use of bank IS ISO IS STABLE!!!!!!!! The distance at the hall stays same @ front and @ back of measured in perceptual world as 3d. Only it as condensed (collapsed) on a single spheric shell do angular measurements differ from ISO. <br>
<br>
Even for same angular height, closer objects the light needs bent more to demudify. Farther objects have less angular spread of mud. The lens is same height for all objects both close and far. Hence, if you "focus" on close object (one eye open), the father stuff will be less resolved due to extreme rays (close to outside of cone) getting bent too much. Again, this is pure geometry.<br>
<br>
To take a picture of a 3D scene, or to view a 3D scene, one must do a (spherical shell collapsing) ray trace. Even with 3D you viewing 3D creation, to look thru the eyes is a ray trace sample. Since you have a 3D perception created-model, not "hard" for mind's eye to swing around and view from side, albeit without color info. It will see basically the "great circles" outlines of objects onto that plane. You would need sphere centered at eye, sphere centered at viewed object (possibly, for mind's eye saccade sweep), and sphere centered at mind's eye side view position. <br>

Physical eye centered sphereset is built starting from 2D (colored, opaque) collapsed spheric shell and draws SPW 3D colored opaque model. There may be also an allocentric (viewed-object-centered?,!) sphereset, which the mind's eye can rotate (saccade)!<br>
<br>
Filler: I think it is better to view one bank as centered at focal point 2' ahead wherever foveas intersect upon. This can help combine the two eyes as needed.<br>
<br>
Mind's eye centered sphereset needs to intersect CMW 3D translucent skins and collapse this to a single spheric shell mind's eye view.<br>
<br>
I think with you moving eye, it is natural for scene to seem stable because the scene changes but you expect it to with eye movement, so net effect is "it's (the scene is) stationary." But with mind's eye, the view change is like an arc shot indicating movement and change of looking angle, so in a sense the scene stays stable here too. But you're trying to view CMW here. It's like mind's eye has to take a reflection of the convex to make it concave to get arc motion rather than true saccade rotation. Could this be the plane of the cube and the unfolding of basketballs?<br>
<br>
With light ray trace, 3D actually comes down into a point (is that 1D or 0D)? How is that even possible? The directions of energies? Direction and frequency and amplitude of <br>
<br>
The whole scene can be created in a "zero point" environment. At least a 2D spheric shell could be mapped out in color from it; need logic to deduce the distances back out.<br>
<br>
Could hex rings be lenses? Hell, could neural tubes be lenses? Could microtubules be lenses?<br>
<br>
Every point in the universe is a different 2D spheric shell picture (41,253 square degrees), all contained in an infinitesimal 0D star of vectors (needs a little time like a microsecond to see different frequencies and amplitude). But how many square minutes or square seconds (finer solid angular resolution)? Hell there's prolly trillions of bits of information in every infinitesimal point in the universe!!! Over time, lower and lower frequencies of EM can be added, increasing the info (contained in each infinitesimal point) exponentially with time because you add the info of the changes or steady sums in higher freqs plus the knowledge of lower freqs. Except that that would be insanely low frequencies that may not really be apprapo (1 ten trillionth Hz and so on) for em or ether.<br>
<br>
You could make a sphere inside image (and video!) and corresponding point star amplitude is length of spike; color is color!!! <br>
<br>
Are quantum other possibility another dimension which we collapse to one layer?<br>
<br>
White light is muddiness of frequency. (Wide Q).<br>

Pres church dude talking about hating shit like that. I copied from image within dream but fairly grey this time.____ was way younger. (Dream)<br>
<br>
It's possible that mind's eye viewing rings and CMW is SPW-spatially-independent. In other words, perhaps walking the ring in SPW is not seen to mind's eye.<br>
<br>
To rebuild the 3rd dimension of distance from 2D retinal image, you must center your sphereset on the pupil of the eye.<br>
<br>
Maybe that concave thing like ray collector looking at single point is actually looking at all of 3D scene, but distance must be added. Like vector star thingy.<br>
<br>
As you approach a pinhole, you no longer need to focus on a plane (no conic spread), and hence larger (infinite) depth of field, but also less light. Cameras always have a larger apperture than this.<br>
<br>
Could rods have been from when we needed that sensitivity, then we evolved a bigger aperture and ability to focus? Pinhole contact lens idea. <br>
<br>
If you trace your eyes along outline path of large square, the center of sphereset also moves in a small square outline path. As does fovea (opposite path). Only the center of the eye (changes vector direction, but) does not translate.<br>
<br>
I suppose that if you have 2D spheric shell mashed down into a star cluster point, it wouldn't matter what absolute size you draw the onion layers, as long as you maintain accuracy in relative sizes between layers. Something measuring 1 degree high to be placed on layer 1, the layer for something 1 degree high to be placed on a layer such that it is actually twice as high in the real universe it needs to go on layer <br>

Unity -> point/ring <br>
Familiarity -> skewers<br>
<br>
Abstract :<br>
<br>
Title-> Rings of Fire: How the Brain Makes Consciousness <br>
<br>
Abstract-><br>
Constraints for consciousness :<br>
(1) The geometry of light dictates that doing a ray trace of 3D environment collapses sphere-shells at every radius to a single sphere shell (and even a point in theory). The brain may take the single sphere shell (or point) and expand it back to full 3D, so it needs a sphereset or bank of shells to convert pixels back to voxels. Theorized to be done in LGN/V1. Object, scene, and face geometries can then be saved.<br>
(2) The nature of time passage means that consciousness probably happens in discrete frames, with the "where" visual path possibly painting color theta-phi plane frames at 40-100 Hz, and the "what" visual path painting roughly 10-40 Hz translucent skin frames in full 3D.<br>
(3) The unity of disparate qualia require a unifying brain language or a single circuit to represent and create consciousness as opposed to other circuits left out of consciousness. The unifier is proposed to be a 3D cursor which moves around in space over time (varying rates 0.25 Hz to 1,000 Hz). Various subregions could have their own specific desired frequency at which the cursor traces out rings in space cyclically. The circuit which is conscious is proposed to be conscious because what it paints over time is the only circuit that is actually trying to draw something over time - this circuit is proposed to be the resonant thalamo-cortico circuit which various from 1-40+ Hz as it alone appears able to bind multiple disparate brain regions together.<br>
(4) The fact we experience familiarity at certain objects, scenes, faces, or concepts like written letters/words, spoken words, indicates that there must be skewers which link together many things by a certain commonality. The commonality may be geometrical closeness or a learned meaning.<br>
<br>
The following deductions are used as support for an experience had with legal hemp gummies. It is proposed that the reason I could see this proposed incipient consciousness was because THC was, as a retrograde messenger, decreasing glutamate release and hyperpolarizing post-synaptic cells, causing HCN1 (and similar) ion channels to open and initiate 2 Hz cyclism of neural firing (possibly in layer 5 of retrosplenial cortex, like with ketamine) and dissociation of disparate brain regions. <br>
<br>
In the experience on January 1st of 2022 (and reconfirmed six times after), all the qualia were seen to start and stop together, as if they were fundamentally the same thing, along with these rings/frames.<br>
<br>
Note - frequency modulation by amplitude modulation by sound would seem like cyclic precession!<br>
<br>
Make vid simpler light is expanding spheres electrons release repellant at speed of light - if they wiggle, perturbations are also carried along ("light") but to ray trace and see it's collapsing spheres.!<br>
<br>

<br>
Skewers built into ring flow. Flow is just old rings. FILLER: It seems to flow because the new meaning is now concerned with a region spatially forward the focus (what meaning is painted) is moving spatially over time. It seems to flow because it seems kicked out cause the ring, like the bank, DOESN'T MOVE!! The updated meaning getting painted forces it to seem to move within SPW but that is just a story; in reality the ring cannot move and hence past stuff only makes sense getting kicked! One point it swung a loop out like crocket hoop which was then ring. Ring just means leading edge of story/consciousness. Not quite like you think. Print head and left print which flows (becomes old flowing to old spatial direction. The direction isn't important just however story throws it out.) only those two things. Meaning is as ring cracks onion open, you see same rock Crack in underlying layers. This is a skewer because nearly the same rumble geometry(dad gum it is a phrase said with a bit of reticense, but less than older layers of every time you said it  as ring goes over. The ring bumps are same and that pattern of bumps is the doing of the motor command to say that, even if just mentally. Earlier I saw heard text as ring going horizontally from left to right and letter deformations were the deviations from line like that text you see. See this is allowed cause perception only has this paint edge (no need for 2000Hz nonsense) <br>
As ring steps forward, meant connecting spot in story jumps too far ahead which makes old seem to have to grow and kick behind.<br>
SPW is painted by it too.<br>
Big coronal ring drew right eye lids up and below cause perspective warp allowed - back of head reg size at same time.<br>
There seems to be but one bank (for visual) 2' in front but tethered with slinky onion layers to both retinas. Like wood puppet. But yes move eyes and it moves but if you hold eye gaze and move head it is slinky again.<br>
Filler: what if there are two simultaneous banks centered on focal object but rotated about object vertical axis so impact two retinas?<br>
Current ring is moving to paster position ring by ring to print anew that new thing as now current spot, till you got your attention (mindeye but idetic with eye for colors spw) headcrownward set it back to old 4/heartbeat . Then DO IT AGAIN lol, and again. Eight rings first then five then three. You have to resist the flow direction or current naturally takes you down your (mind)eye is naturally down rotated flowed step by step, you exert force to resist and pull back.<br>
<br>
Skewers are passing thru some memory frames just interchanged like CMW or SPW frame rings.<br>
<br>
While his eye is looking down and always to center of bank, mind's eye ie story could be looking up through forehead. Include when  thinking about lgn!!!<br>
<br>
I cast down those imaginations! Each frame is a slicing plane thru him which makes him move muscles of whole body for that phrase. Even the tensing up of body drawn.<br>
Skewer could be axial spine laying down rings <br>
<br>
Filler: helix driving muscles means a temporal sequence of muscle commands. At each moment there is a whole set of signals going down to muscles. This is why it appears that helix "drives" muscle movements. Sometimes muscle movement intentions included in consciousness, sometimes not. It's just whatever you're including in focus is written in consciousness. Maybe thalamus decides when to include these collaterals into consciousness story.<br>
<br>
The balls t____ ring frames done as image view from head even tho eyes closed then rings went up and changed attitude to charge my mind eye spine laying down rings and looking up. <br>
<br>
It might not hear all the hertz just enough stuff to paint that he hears it in story. All these things you just have to depict someone experiencing the smell of whatever hearing the sound.<br>
Not really hearing as you thought, huh? <br>
<br>
Storybook Consciousness <br>
Might be good name for upcoming book. <br>
Filler: or, The Geometry of Consciousness <br>
<br>
Eye open seems like dude rises up from bed rings to if laying in front of you his feet at your left (?)arm swivels up like you looking direction CCW while eyes open, then as soon as you close your eyes rings collapse down as walk to leftward (flow to rightward).<br>
Prolly cause you can have 3d rings like the sulfur or like now which are chunks of matter<br>
Like there's a hidden piano key 3d slot (think object slot) several but object of attention fills only one. Like quantum jumps these are where ring can currently walk to. These could be the bank unfolded. Bank as hidden thing with wires okay yea you're on track. But bank as often appears is the larger die that prints consciousness and at times you can see Georgia not like Georgia but maybe a memory frame you had of georgia and what shape you thot it was.<br>
Broken glass might be axial spine of laying rings. But usually bank only uses maybe 10 sphere shells and thick and with air gaps so can do slinky (feel that word not the literal slinky action) spirograph thing which appears at least often a key component of story laying (=consciousness).<br>
So do you really see the scene at all, or is that what passing between frames feels like and is pattern used for that (close to it at least)scene. The clear altruistic meaning that you think is there isn't really there, but rather that's what is attempted to be painted.<br>
Admittedly color is the most beautiful component of story printing like looking at deep chalks of tribal people. Or Indian chalk explosion. Enjoy that. So yeah parasagittal side rings come over to phone eyes open up and rings expand to 3d sulfur kinda weird shape.<br>
The ring walks by moving to new place in bank not just within SPW. That bank truly is all and always stationary which paints all.<br>
When you walk, you take bank "with you" thru STORY (perceptual-only), but as that is story and not real the bank isn't moving, but rather world depicted by story is advanced opposite direction.<br>
You could have a helix that intersects walked up (AGU) circles (rings) at changing slightly advancing phase every time like 20-40 times (maybe less) to get a cyclic revolution (over 2-4 seconds). (FILLER: Could the phasic advance take place in the silence between rings????? Wouldn't be proportional tho) Prolly 10hz and 7 Hz. Spine becomes helix when alpha exceeds theta by just a little (0.5 Hz)? If copacetic, perhaps theta is the ring-circles, and alpha is the spine. And perhaps a low 0.25 Hz can be created by that spirographic interplay of the two. Study this!!<br>
<br>
1/4 ring drawing CMW at one spatial spot and other 3/4 drawing SPW above it and rotating about axis dividing the two roughly but changing. CMW overlaying SPW.<br>
There may be rings around a ring with all those repping a zoomed in section of time and makimg roughness skin of ring. Perhaps this why two 2Ds at once.<br>
<br>
Consciousness with gaps it still feels like without gaps like song etc.<br>
<br>
I thought dad gum had same rings but prolly hipp did that but still muscle program same or very very close.<br>
<br>
Flow (~0-3 m/s) happens when the advance of the printhead (=ring) within the stable bank is less than the advance of where the ring is painting within the model world of SPW or CMW.<br>
<br>
Blow (~10 m/s) happens when CMW old 3D frames are getting blown consistently away, creating a flying feeling.<br>
<br>
But yea, printhead (="ring"), and that left (ink, fades over 0.5-5 seconds). That is 100% of consciousness. <br>
<br>
Filler: I guess at high enough temporal resolution, all there is is perturbations (by "3D cursor"). I think the higher amp, slower freq (10 Hz?) flashes you see are "frames" (CMW) with higher freq lower amp being coloration (SPW).<br>
<br>
Filler: It's constantly changing the meaning of what is painted which advances the "ring" in perceptual space (SPW) AND changing the shape of the "ring" to change the focus (CMW). SO once again, you are using passage of time to move (via changed meaning painted) in third spatial dimension.<br>
<br>
All the rest is just descriptions of patterns of behavior and mechanisms for achieving things. <br>
<br>
And consciousness is easier to understand if you first close your eyes, cause eyes open visual scene is rather more complicated to envision.<br>
<br>
Anyway, Like bank is just the bigger die that can print any "ring" (including 3D shapes/visual scenes skin of viewer eye boundary and that seen boundary), and skewer is a hippocampal tool to immediately create (geometrically) sense of familiarity with like 10-100 previous instances thereof and ring gears is a way to implement motor plan. Flow and walk are just the "movements" of newest printhead location relative to bank and meaning printed spatial spot movement in story (as including SPW and CMW). Throw is just however printhead prints meaning of inertial forces either by throwing it's own self off center from where in bank it was or however it chooses. <br>
<br>
This consciousness story is the unifying brain language for subregions on need to know basis.<br>
<br>
As far as frequencies, yea there are cyclic laying of patterns like compressions perhaps of firing make distinct rings but as far as printhead goes, the ring printhead just prints in real time. It isn't really a frequency. If there is a freq then prolly 40+ Hz but all the time it is printing stuff. Maybe eyes closed is when you see more bunching at 10-20 Hz and therefore distinct ring frames. But even eyes closed if it's really getting into CMW story it can seem to be high freq and maybe even colored.<br>
Broken glass could be bank unfurls to refresh painting of consciousness around a tilted axis when bank is upright.<br>
<br>
Corrections to vid:<br>
Add eye lgn v1 path image or graphic <br>
Clarify near-hemisphere <br>
Simplify <br>
Way less text, but scale = 1.<br>
Killer opening screen including right size <br>
<br>
Appears right eye fovea is 1/3rd in with 2/3rd periphery to it.<br>
<br>
It could be that what looks like a edge getting drawn at once is, at higher temporal zoom, laid cyclically at say 40 Hz. But it could also be continuous.<br>
<br>
I mean the buzzing of creating that bleeding edge of consciousness looks not unlike the buzzing of the brain.<br>
<br>
Filler: does it get meaning of where in perceptual space to place cursor and what 3D movie fits in this helix over time from a language of temporal patterns? Ie consciousness would be nothing more than pulses over time if the "reading consciousness" part of brain didn't have an interpreter/Placer code both first for where in perceptual space to put cursor and then an interpreter for what the zig/zigs on helix mean (what 3D video it should hallucinate).<br>
<br>
Still, The main question is, how is bank get its perceptual space?<br>
<br>
Filler: Did God give us control of these bodies? Cause jeez it seems like there must be an alien to drive it or it would just be a robot. Like what the hell can actually look at the meaning implied in the images and then guide body thereby?? FILLER: HOW ABOUT THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX?!<br>
<br>
Dream: on car trip with family, ___ (or fake ___?) interviewed me for a job in a booth (like a cross between a tent and a photo white box). "Your relative so and so was in ___ back in____"(outside, before I agreed to an interview he said that) also, John sat with me cause he was on the trip too. But at the end, "here's the serum you've heard of " I said, what's in it? "house entrails...." I looked inside looked like pitri dish 2" deep of liquid, mold growing atop. Thinking how I'm vegan and I guess they f*cking  killed a horse for this stupid preparation, and also that I guess it's basically sh*t and might f*ck me up, I said no thanks and walked out, somehow then got trapped in another ___ interview building (this one they had signs like "obey don't question" for the interviewees, had to leave my stuff cause quickly found an openable window, found they had stole my car (btw cars drive on tops of skyscrapers in Oregon), so ran for awhile, then ended up atop skyscraper buildings and had to fight a dude. Superman or something was second-but-top floor (below me), so as he was breaking plutonium reactor thing and cause meltdown I left bad dude with him and descended stairs, found out what hotel it was, and called mom to pick me up. Mom had gotten a lot of money playing a phone app card game but not even winning.<br>

Anywho, bleeding edge (1,2, or 3D) printhead and ink. Or simplify more and just say fading ink.<br>
You can see the fade if you look at a bright object and close your eyes suddenly - takes about 0.2 seconds to fade. There should exist a perceptual lumens scale. Perhaps with hemp the whole color scene is diminished so that it looks more see thru and then the fade lasts longer (no longer overexposed) like 0.5-5 seconds where you can see better what consciousness is doing.<br>
<br>
Placing pixels at the right depth would be capable of inverting the image. Not sure if brain does invert back or not.<br>
<br>
The "foveal ray" from each eye can only intersect each other at a single radius r (and also, you can only focus the cones [du-mud-ify] pixels coming from a certain radius r). <br>
<br>
Could it be mind's eye saccades to trace letters while physical eye saccades less frequently, jumping from first letter to last letter? (Thus the "meaning being at zero conic degree angle" thing!?). The physical eye saccades based on what it can resolve area at a time. There are skewers going backward linking every time you've read that phrase (?). With hipp help perhaps.<br>

Spatial separation the communicator sends expanding sphere the communicatee receives collapsing sphere. Just a geometrical but little known fact of optic transmission.<br>

Cursor movement phasic advance along ring is earth splitting of the earth of bank revealing chasm with same current peculiar zig zags as ring (FILLER: Could this phasic advance to centroid of bank [earlier memories/instances of doing ie motor command implementation by overarching helical drive] be the traveling waves of the hipp?) and underlying layers are previous doings of that phrase. So now we have an entirely new paint-by-memory thing -> an action(=consciousness)-by-memory thing. Familiarity is had by breaking earth along ring zig zag and looking at layers. It equals consciousness because that is the print head. The print head is zig zagging in same way as other times which are shown below which causes the movements of body to produce that speech even if not vocalized the info is there to implement the saying of it.<br>
<br>
Alz, pfc stops knowing that it is familiar with things so loses confidence but can still do stuff. Or, could hipp do familiarity of visual stuff, and cerebellum is the hipp of motor? Hence difficulty of movement without cerebellum?<br>

You get kicked out when walking because you is a story and the bank never moves therefore you has to get kicked out behind when you finally SEE the bank! Otherwise story fools you that you're in the real world. When you lie on side, bank (in story) seems to have fallen over, but remember bank never moves therefore story is kicked out swivel to right rotating about axis thru (of) hcu. When you lie down on bed, you swivel story forwards about axis thru hips. But because bank is in new position, to the you lying in bed, the you of past that was sitting up seems like it got kicked out from present coronal ring even tho it didn't move in story in position. Because to the Stationary bank, that you did get kicked forward and into its face. It's like bank relative to where it is now, but since it doesn't move in reality, that which was printed must move.<br>

With a sphere shell image, you can select a picture from any attitude. Perhaps brain fills in enough Vectors to back to have translucent skins so that attitude changes are easy.<br>
<br>
When you turn your head, you don't rotate the world that the Vectors are going thru. Speaking of Central foveal ray.. The old rays hold in their position and direction.<br>
<br>
Like if I jump my eye from ceiling wall intersection to light fixture, the central foveal ray isn't at zero degrees (it doesn't care about foveal having a fixed ray assigned to it), it's at the ray in the SPW from ceiling wall intersection to fovea, then the ray from ceiling light to (also translational movement shifted as well as rotated) fovea! The foveal ray is jumping from one SPW ray vector to another. Or just, the fovea is jumping from one attitude within fixed SPW to another. Or just, jumps fovea to a previous other spot on retina.<br>

Could 10, 100 Hz waves provide unification in time for firings of neurons at different cortical depths with feet being particularly subcortical to allow cyclic precession to trace flow down to feet to arrive at same time in perceptual model as hands?<br>
<br>
The printhead of refreshing consciousness (SPW) is often (movified) shaped like what you're thinking of (CMW), and can even model SPW in the shape (raised relief) if you're paying attention to that.<br>
<br>
Try to see what ratio the spheres stick out past the cubes.<br>
<br>
Funny how the pineapple slices seemed to get a cubic packing container it fits in or to compare against at very last moment of frame.<br>
<br>
As you see puzzle wooden bank unfurl, does phase provide distance (radius), from maximal to minimal? And slinky like cause there is ringical phasic advance (rotation of layer of bank shell) during same time?<br>
<br>
At what ratio sphere:cube does dCUBE cubed = pi/6 * dSPHERE cubed? Find dSPHERE:dCUBE to satisfy this. Let's allow dCUBE to be 1. So find dSPHERE to satisfy 1=pi/6*dSPHERE cubed. So, cube root of 6/pi (cube root of 1.9098)-> 1.2407.<br>
So radius needs to be 24.07% bigger than half cube length for equal volume, not that equal volume is necessarily how the brain relates the two, but trying it out for size.<br>
<br>
Square root of 2 is 1.414<br>
Cube root of 3 is 1.44225<br>
<br>
Or, if we take sphere radius as unit value 1, then cube "radius" needs to be <br>
<br>
rCUBE:rSPHERE = 0.806 (?)<br>
<br>
The brain does seem to use some symmetric or simple Geometrical shapes - concentric cubes and spheres (and cylinders?), but most of the shapes of consciousness are rather blobby. Need rather a point cloud skin.<br>
<br>
It's like the brain uses the language of pictures to assess and determine how to guide the body response, but we don't see images anywhere getting made. It's like the brain responds to the meaning conveyed by the picture, but how can such meaning exist? Robots wouldn't care if they  were presented with a picture of their own toe getting stubbed, but we do.<br>
<br>
When I walk down a trail, yes there is a physical me walking down a real trail, but what I perceive is a story, and tho I am moving thru the world in the story, it isn't real motion cause it's a story. It's like when you see someone walking in a movie, are they really walking 5 miles? Well, no, inside the movie on the TV screen the screen isn't moving at all. Within the story told by the movie, he is walking 5 miles thru a real world, but as it is a depiction, it isn't really 5 miles of action movement of the TV image. So with perception: if you walk 5 miles, as far as perception is concerned, you never even budged! The world moved against you. <br>
<br>
There's one more layer of complexity - your brain that supposedly prints the consciousness does move 5 miles as you walk, but apparently chronospatiogenesis is used and hence the printhead of perception does not move.<br>
<br>
So I wonder if you could get 3D by moving cursor with 2D Vectors about in a ring ("eye" moves around). How would neural firing rep a star cluster? I doubt this is the means.<br>
<br>
It can paint in above transverse plane (you are laying down) and you looking in direction that new paint layers keep getting spatially added.<br>
<br>
So let's say it is just chronospatiogenesis. Does non-spec provide ring shape and attitude (and phase and frequency?)? But my point was, what paints color? And as you see, chrono doesn't have to paint a ring, it sometimes has to paint a little plane like above paragraph. Could still zig zag across at high temporal resolution to paint the plane, or maybe it gets printed all at once (seems more patent). But let's just look at ring for a sec. So could color be a finer temporal resolution? This would be paint-by-phase within an already temporally tiny frequency. Like a miniature version of paint-by-cyclic-precession. Putting color as the finest subdivision of time seems poor as color never seems to get broken - lesions cause all kinds of other problems but nothing starts taking away color. If finest subdivision, it would seem most susceptible to error as brain misfunctions. Anywho, what do you have to work with besides time? Neurons don't really have amplitude since APs are all or nothing events. So thal-cor circuit neurons supposedly do freq-mod in response to "amp-mod," by which amp-mod is meant "hyper-depolarization."<br>
<br>
Or, could there be a blue bank, yellow bank, and red bank (again, simplified as the single bank just some other power-efficient means to distinguish accessings)? Or red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple banks? Remember these are oriented in a ring (not to be confused with your rings). Are there sets of "banks" dedicated to repping intensity? <br>
<br>
At least with the ring, with star cluster, you paint each point on ring as what color the spike from eye that would intersect it is. Them the ring can do depth perception, focused thing by focused thing. Anywhere in the image you turn your eyes, ring can place at depth. Only sometimes it appears ring is AWOL to both "that-being-looked-at" and the looker.<br>
<br>
In image below, you predominantly see the hand of the right eye and the door of the left eye (hand of left eye is mostly transparent to allow seeing of bar code; door of right eye is mostly transparent to allow seeing of monkey tail). This weird config allows seeing as many potential dangers as possible.<br>
<br>
If you rotate your eye up, it is not only a different image, but the centroid of ray inversion is in an arc translated (different) location. Is this the centroid of bank that seems 2' away from you and center of fovea direction? So when you rotate eye up and centroid seems to move arc of 2.5', maybe it's only the arc of the pupil which (wait, even the retina arc translates same amount, sheesh)... It's a little dish image that is at center of eyeball which is always the 3D rotation pivot point. Funny the eye isn't designed with pivot point at pupil. Ostensibly, this pivot point isn't even conscious, altho might be drawn in story. So in rotating the eye, there is arc translation of the 3D image collection point (0D) of pupil, but see-saw counter-arc-translation of collection of inverted rays at retina. It's like a 90° cone pinhole camera with pinhole at point, 3D rotatable about a centroid point within the cone. Is this why rings, cause there's a ring of great circle of cone at rotation point, and the rotation point is always stationary, hence bank <br>
<br>
All you have to do to read LRUD inverted "3D<br>
rotatable about a centroid point within the cone" is ROTATE 180°!!! Which means you don't have to do anything, since perception is a self-consistent story and needn't (and perhaps cannot, as abstract) map to reality. You place the whole sentence (and whole phone screen), tho upon a convex retinal surface, on a certain plane in 3D. Hence, the sphere with part cut inwards to phone depth. The window kind of thing.<br>
<br>
So does perception use ONE SPHERE  with displaced mappings from two eyes to show those two sphere contributions? The eyeballs' contribution are spheres with everything coming to a point (centroid of sphere) cause you have spikes that go there in meaning or in other words in reality ie by geometrical fact and requirement. The foveal centermost spike from each eye these two agree upon a single thing in the universe (actually they don't, but brain averages the 2" of displacement of pupils into WHERE an imaginary pupil in between would be, at top of[above] nose). It can do this cause it doesn't matter where perception is drawn. Left eye sees world as existing more to right of itself. Right eye sees world as existing more to left of itself. Hence, by moving perception creation of left eye leftwards a little and perception creation of right eye rightwards a little, the two join up, at least at foveal center point.<br>
<br>
The inverted images, however, need to be pulled MEDIALLY, not laterally!! And this is what seems to happen in perception!<br>
<br>
Normal thinking, each eye has perception shifted too medially with negative hence overlap and has to be pulled apart to integrate. But really, images are flipped on the two retinas so that the perception model of each (perception views them at what you'd call a 180° rotation about axis going from front of head to back of head) is too lateral and therefore must be pulled medial.<br>
<br>
Rotation inwards or outwards based on how far away is focal plane you're looking at. But translation <br>
<br>
It feels like your right eye is open when you left eye actually is, and vice versa. But perceptually, <br>
<br>
Right eye sees image rotated CW (viewed from above) about axis going vertically thru focal point in real world. Left eye sees image rotated CCW (viewed from above) about axis going vertically thru focal point in real world. Both, whether for close or far focal point. For a near object in focus, rotation is greater.<br>
<br>
Perceptual left eye (=actual right eye inverted retinal image) does "ray trace" from different, more leftward spot, and, when focused on finger, finds shoe is somewhat to right of finger. Right perceptual eye always sees finger aligned to edge of shoe regardless of close or far focus.<br>
<br>
If it's focused on finger, has to show both versions of shoe. If focused on shoe, has to show both versions of finger. In moving from far to close focus, shoe must split into two copies, with perceptual left eye's copy going rightwards. In going from close to far focus, finger must split in two, with perceptual left eye's copy going LEFTWARDS!<br>
<br>
The spheres seem to roll along the focal looking axis with overlap. This allows a middle finger to totally criss cross as you go from close to far focus. Two false copies of a single finger trade places with each other. Where the heck are the origin points of these two spheresets? Way way way off to left and to right? How does that make sense? What is radius to focal point? Does radius shrink with closer focii??<br>
<br>
Here's something insane, but hold phone close to left eye but so far left field of view that right eye can barely see it. Letters appear (angular theta and phi terms) larger and different plane to left eye than to right eye!<br>
<br>
Between a line (edge of my finger) at 8" away and between guitar neck edge at 12'8" away, there appears to be 8° of angular theta displacement about axis vertically thru finger or thru guitar neck. Or, 4° in each direction in splitting into two. Prolly more like 12°, 6°-> 2.5" (5") on "unit pinky sphere." <br>
<br>
Phi=0° makes a complete plane; phi=90° makes a line. All others make conic angle "planes." Tiny theta slices make infinitely tall pie slices! Radius tiny slices make spheric shells.<br>
<br>
Conic slice intersection with sphere is circle (well, a warped washer ring that ball could tuck into for total intersection, or a French horn bell out for mapping thin side of sphere to thin side of cone and thicks to thicks). Conic slice intersection with pie slice is a pencil sharpener shaving (or trapezoidal blocks with one concave side for sphere to fit like in broken up rings). Pie slice intersection with a sphere is a lady bug wing (or warped pencil sharpener shaving).<br>
<br>
In chronospatiogenesis, the 3D cursor doesn't actually move - well, it does, but only within the perceptual creation of SPW. In chronospatiogenesis, EVEN THE BANK isn't there (only used as reference)(if it leaks and says tell me about every point [instead of the one current point of cursor], then you can "see" the structure of it). But if 2 or 3 dimensions can be on printhead, then there'd be a need for bank to have spatial existence somehow. Perhaps there are parallel circuits when pfc (or whatever) asks for multiple points at once. <br>
<br>
In chronospatiogenesis, the 3D cursor "moves" within perceptual space (SPW/CMW) by changing what it is painting. It moves, in paint task, to a new spatial point moment by moment, and these points, connected together, tend to often make arcs and rings.<br>
<br>
Perhaps all points within bank are firing, but frequency of each is muddy, and 3D cursor brings ones at a certain location into tight Q.<br>
<br>
So that since PFC also has access to the bank, it "understands" where the cursor is painting moment by moment and can have a 3D video therefrom. It can say, "I want 3D cursor to move to this point next, this point next," and thereby direct the path of the ring. In other words, "Paint me what's happening here." Back half paints it. "Okay now here." Back half paints it. "Now here." So that when motor cortex issues commands, they seem to come from the current location on the ring, even if spatially that body member movement isn't spatially on ring (perhaps cyclic precession used to show axial offset). And hence why it feels like the full motor program is just the helix. Could this be how a 3D visual scene can end up mapped to a segment of ring? Cause pfc asked for visual info for that segment of time and hence each split moment 3D image got mapped to a point along the ring? If so, does it just tighten visual info's Q to heighten the focus thereupon? Which 3D image has each point referenced to main perceptual internal model bank, including where the seer is. Or maybe where path maps to a 2D "retinobank" with known codes for known locations, rather than retinotopic; and what path, when modeling SPW, has 3D translucent skins. Perhaps visual has to be printed on the plane of the ring. Who knows. Something like that!?<br>
<br>
Perhaps scatter mode paint can do 3D printhead as it's asking for random pixels over time which is more emphasis on 3D form. And the more linear mode of rings has a method to the movement (waves that track in a direction).<br>
If so, one layer (1?, 2/3?, 5?) with interconnections would seem necessary to be dedicated to where in bank that neuron is (like left hand certain patch of skin for 3D mode, okay, but is hand swung in front of body or behind body, and show changing over time). Seems whole brain must have access to this perception master bank - could it be located in the LGN or pulvinar? Or non-spec of thalamus?Or hipp?<br>
<br>
Supposedly, SPWleftEye and SPWrightEye are merged into somewhat overlapping SPW in V2, no doubt with help from lgn and maybe pulvinar.<br>
<br>
But, since the cyclopification appears capable of using 2D sphere shell or star cluster, maybe that doesn't prove V2 is necessarily handling 3D. After all, you at least play around with the idea that SPW is wholly sphere-shellic, with no 3D at all unless and when CMW models that for it. Still, it could be that V2 is handling 3D. Just dunno.<br>
<br>
It appears possible for cyclopification to rotate two sphere shells (left eye, right eye) to where the spheres lock to each other in middle. Or rotate whole 3D SPWleft and SPWright to same amount to merge the foveal vector of left and right eye.<br>
<br>
Prolly the reason for the merging of left only at focal and right only at focal then both eyes and merge is cause each SPW (left eye, right eye) gets mapped to a slightly offset location in bank, then with both eyes you have to come to middle and join and so it does.<br>
<br>
I suppose you could have partial pen shell in 3D from left eye vantage, and partial pen shell in 3D from right eye vantage, and join them into one without scrunching. There would still be "crossed" disparity for closer fingers and uncrossed disparity for farther fingers, just by geometry.<br>
<br>
Atimes, it appears that, as looking at phone, even tho fan is doubled behind me, not very noticeable, and seems brain is letting in this case left eye be dominant for background and both eyes equal for phone. In this way, and as before, objects can use both eyes, or one or the other, to give a mish mash of which eye is contributing and what strength to various objects as needed.<br>
<br>
Neurospatial ("retinotopic") maps are cool (even the possibly 3D neurospatial LGN), but at the end of the day, they do not demonstrate the precise geometries of perceptual experience. There has to be a bank whose layout is not done by the messiness of neural layouts, but by some means. What is that means? Could changing frequencies designate the radius?<br>
<br>
Could the "retinotopic" map of V1 be not x and y, but (geometrically required) theta and phi? Why does phi make circles but theta makes pie slices? How do you carve a hemisphere up into equal segments that doesn't specialize a particular axis?<br>
<br>
Perhaps the brain starts with 3D points, and bank is learned as useful shapes. Why it centers every one I don't know. Why only spheres and cubes I don't know. Why is the center of cylinders offset? Why is axis of cylinders tilted?<br>
<br>
If so, how does it place the points in the first place? X, y, z? But how specifically would it even do that?<br>
<br>
Does it rather begin with the eye (retina->LGN)? Does eye compute depth before sending? Like could LGN be the bank?<br>
<br>
Plus, why does the change between shapes feel like something? How can feeler influence direction of story depicted within shape progression? Yea time is magical and all, but without neural firing, time plus body movement does not produce consciousness and you'd be a vegetable.<br>
<br>
Is consciousness the actions done (by PHZ) upon ring (provided by PFC[or brainstem]), but it (PFC [or brainstem]) can interact with what it's seeing? Actually, thalamus non-spec is better seat than brainstem.<br>
<br>
Cortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons see primary (specific) input as well as TWO non-spec inputs, and are part of the thalamo-cortical resonant circuit.<br>
<br>
So, is consciousness the actions done (by 1 spec  and 2 non-spec type influences) upon ring (provided by layer 5 pyramidal neurons firing to thalamus), but it (collective of layer 5 neurons) can interact with what it's seeing?<br>
<br>
<br>
Jeez this lower image calls them layer 6 pyramidal neurons! Which is it?!<br>
<br>
Examine rate of physiological tremor high and sober. Those are the rings (at least muscle wise, maybe not most fundamental ring). See if they slow down or get more cyclified high.<br>

All you can do in thinking is premotor-> move muscles or the image to move without moving.<br>
<br>
Llinás: we don't "want" to do something, the brain system is set up to always move and to do so as best as possible to avoid danger. There is predictive prophesy - brain paints image (via stimulation for go towards and via inhibition for avoid?) of future (paint running away) and then you go into that. "Free will: those activities that happen that the brain knows are about to happen.""I changed my mind" foot example - stimulate with transcranial (TMS) foot goes inward, he tried to move outward and never could, said he "changed his mind." Experiment revealed he could not differentiate "him" deciding to move from TMS deciding to move. Electrical stim felt like he chose to move. "If I know that it is going to happen then I think I did it." You take possession of something that doesn't belong to you. "Free will is knowing what you're going to do, not willing it. Sorry."<br>
<br>
"40 Hz" paints a video on the 10 Hz dt blocks.<br>
<br>
Perhaps flow and walk somewhat combine into a sort of hamster wheel or walking up a DESCENDING escalator. Each step of ring up does move up, but since whole canvas is flowing down, it's not a lot of upwards net displacement in bank. Perhaps walk can hand off to flow and vice versa not necessarily sinusoidal but however brain wants to write story.<br>
<br>
I kind of regret calling CMW "story," cause really all of consciousness is story, even the SPW part whether as background or as actually modeled by CMW. <br>
<br>
Phase within pulse gives phase. Let there be a forwards face of cube or self, rotation perpendicular to phase axis plus rotation perpendicular to rotation axis (okay cause previous is changing) is 3D rotation.<br>
<br>
I could see colors eyes closed awake (red line, green balls of various hue, etc) unless I was actually asleep.<br>

Perhaps uses geometry images changing over time not due to reading meaning but as how to drive body or mind into future in certain way. Because the real universe is roughly geometrical.<br>

Local circuits must provide own relative phase and flow rate.<br>
<br>
Still, how can change of freq be so fluid and no disjointed phase jumps? Is there one master focused freq (better, speed) which varies as it checks in on all the spread out children?<br>
<br>
Why did bass rings appear completely aloof from muscle movements of playing bass or was that an abnormality and why muscle movements were out of whack?<br>
<br>
Frequency is a sort of macroscopic, sloppy cycle -level average speed measurement. Instantaneous speed can be perfectly accurate.<br>
<br>
Does frequency always involve a hidden imaginary component that reverses the electron?<br>
<br>
Maybe you feel like you lose will when you cannot predict the next frame. Like when you're not ready and you still get pulled.<br>
<br>
Perhaps bank is subiculum and concentric forms due to grouping geo-like together as closely as possible.<br>
<br>
Perhaps brain commands wouldn't effect anything useful unless they learned a ring pattern (in perceptual space) without even knowing they were using it? Here, perceptual space is meant like, if there is a universe, it must be geometrical. <br>

Dreamed in color. At beach with s, mountains in Ocean. Muddy rivers bus drive thru. Crazy house we stayed at. I found "witch" at top cavity leading to roof access. Bus wouldn't return cause even more flooding so we had to walk it. Other groups were trying to kill as they went thru. Didn't make sense but it's no different from war which doesn't make sense. Once made it back to starting point, it was the send off house (also at Ocean). Sender off dude didn't like me saying the stuff that had happened so asked me to leave the same way he came in. And to check back now and then. It seems like that to the extent you believe something is real, it will be colorized as opposed to translucent. Like even daydreams atimes may be colored.<br>
<br>
Paper towels, litter scooped, trash out <br>
<br>
Maybe when one has less movement than other in same duration (move to a slightly closer point on bank than movement depicted by paint in SPW), then you can create the spirographic element of ring of rotor and stator. Ie of smaller bank rolling in larger cavity. Actually it is same distance it is just different circumferences (and radii), so that one (bank) completes self rotation before reaching starting point, which makes a counter-moving "spine."<br>
<br>
What are the two things that when meet up fire AP and reveal 3D cursor? I think bank has to be one. How does SPW/CMW tie in? Cause I thought SPW was a bank colored-skin print too. Two instances of bank?<br>
<br>
Need to determine for sure if bank center moves when move eyes (not head silly) and if hysteresis, and if so how much hysteresis.<br>
<br>
Well the two things are the smaller bank (how are jars done???) and the image-bank (larger stable SPW use of bank OR smaller, movable CMW use of bank). Since SPW must be done with primary, then non-spec must be the smaller bank who, rolling around in SPW bank, draws a ring.<br>
<br>
In other words prolly some number of cortical neurons (or just say one for right now) repping a point. <br>
<br>
I guess as long as brain region knows to paint right color, doesn't have to have bank of SPW/CMW at layer 5. What would this mean? That layer 5 is points within small bank, and selects which point with primary saying where and (??????).<br>
<br>
I don't think APs can say "where." I think the right neuron has to be selected in layer 5 to fire upon (target) to establish "where" (ie what point in bank), and perhaps temporal, amplitude, phase, frequency, Q components matter.<br>
<br>
Here we go! Let sphere shell of cortex be points on bank (NSG or PSG). Now, let non-spec have this bank. Then, only (massive) fire SPW/CMW when a point in question on SPW/CMW would align with that point in non-spec bank!<br>
<br>
Could be that primary gets bank and non-spec fires when...<br>
<br>
Dunno tho if there is sufficient divergence cause you'd need to map a single non-spec neuron to every point in SPW bank or vice versa. Maybe non-spec has a bank in cortex too, and the whole non-spec going everywhere is like, okay at this one point in time when it is just a 3D cursor, go to which point in SPW/CMW bank(s) it intersects with. This seems more copacetic. So you have to beforehand specify which point on non-spec bank we're talking about, then take exact branch to go to "point" in SPW bank (which could be not just a single neuron, but more likely a population group of neurons, some from each sensory modality). Could hipp be non-spec's bank? Or could cerebellum be non-spec's bank?<br>

Hand somatosensory-> it's receptive field is a certain point on hand, not where it is in space. Eye V1-> it's receptive field is a certain spot (/angle) on retina, not where it is in space. Ear A1-> it's receptive field is a certain frequency, not where it is in space. Does non-spec, going thru brainstem (close to SC, IC) place these things on a bank of SPW (and CMW if needed)? Or select which is on current cursor and over time shows 3D locations?<br>
<br>
SC/IC could provide "unconscious" where which rings use to tie cortex SPW/CMW to current cursor. Because tho it can't carry info, it can say "when" a pixel (voxel) is on ring. But supposedly you can still have sense of space without SC/IC so I guess not.<br>
<br>
I think the "language" of the thalamus has to be the 3D cursor.<br>
<br>
I guess as a possible alternative, what if non-spec reaches out to the single cursor spot, but where the spot is on two banks - the SPW bank and the "ring-drawing" bank? So all the points in each bank get the same subpopulation of MINI-COLUMNS to rep, but SPW bank uses one type of neuron (or layer? or sub-sub pop?), and "ring- drawing" bank uses another?<br>
<br>
Could visual be 40Hz bringing focus back up manually from flow?<br>
<br>
Maybe waterslide is layer 5 (6?) firing to enact muscle movement, but ring draw is thal-cor bursts? Doesn't really make sense. I think layer 5 must be 3D cursor driving muscle movement, then in between rings is when signal reaches muscles and put into action (?) and simultaneous with thal-cor bursts. Or does thal-cor burst same time as layer 5? Or at least usually, but really high they separate in time where you can feel the difference?<br>
<br>
If muscle movements are the ring, how do you explain being able to shift between triplets and eighths on a snare? Does this shift base frequency? It would have to. Unless muscle movements are placed on ring but not same cyclic sessions as rings.<br>
<br>
Working memory is disappative (fading ink).<br>
There's episodic. (=declarative?)<br>
There's familiarity.<br>
There's muscle memory.<br>
Implicit memory is pin prick avoidance, but not know you know doctor. Hipp not needed for this.<br>
Henry had all memories of pre operation time, but could make no new memories.<br>
Henry Molaisson- anterograde amnesia <br>
Old folks- retrograde amnesia<br>
<br>
Like blind sight when you can see Brad able to do math calculation and state answer, but completely unconscious of doing the math problem.<br>
<br>
"This is it." Cerebrum is SPW/CMW, cerebellum (sent back) is the ring that ties SPW to CMW (and to ring bank?). Cerebellum turns cerebrum bank in all sorts of ways. Hipp is flow that allows looking upon your current experience so as to note it and make memory(?).<br>
<br>
Where in perceptual space it is relative to the ring. This is why everything can be driven by moving images without ever even drawing the images themselves. Because you draw a point - a 3D cursor - at any given instantaneous moment (portion of 1/10th second or portion of 1/40th second - not really instantaneous). You don't draw the whole image cause movie is too much processing power - draw just a point that moves in rings over time.<br>
<br>
It (cursor) moves because the thing viewing the modulated signal knows how it moves. Both drawers and viewers are prolly layer 5 pyramidal.<br>
<br>
What if all primary provides is frequency of rings for that local circuit, and non-spec provides globally consistent attitude and shape?<br>
<br>
Or what if non-spec provides two frequencies - 10 Hz, 40 Hz, and primary paints with input from cortex, and hipp provides ring shapes, and cortex provides ring attitude?<br>
<br>
It's like brain knows where cursor is painting without actually knowing. How?? It has to have a global 3D matrix space for geometrically consistent movements. Could top cerebellum be phi (sagittal circle), yet undiscovered be theta, and bottom two be 45° tilted phi and theta? LGN provides radius. Or is bottom two more like that tilted cylinder that rotates an already build cerebral model into alignment?<br>
<br>
I mean prolly the vestibular provides the info for "head bank," where would boxes and spheres get built??<br>
<br>
I guess it's possible that "it all starts (functionally) with the head" as far as vestibular system is placed there, you solve from there to body based on how neck muscles are and from head to world viewed by eyes. Nevertheless, perceptually, the head is NOT painted as being the reference, but rather as one of the most freely moving and DETACHED parts. The local environs is presented as stable and as the SEEMING reference point. Oh, and head vestibular is needed to determine gravity (AGU) - that's a big deal - maybe even big enough that it will lead to finding the local environs bank along path.<br>
<br>
MGN has refractory period of 1ms. Therefore can't fire any faster tonically than 1,000 Hz. So how is 2,000 Hz sound repped?<br>
<br>
Bursting is CMW; tonic is paint (color)(SPW) (?).<br>
<br>
Is perceptual space just the marriage of a sensory input to the movement needed to get there?<br>
<br>
What if matter/charge expands at the speed of light, but light perturbations expand at c-squared? In other words what if we have memory because everything we lay down stays spatially with us? And so our whole life is bunched in a single wavefront?<br>
<br>
It's not so much that you can conjure up geometrical forms like a square in your head. It's more like you learn sequences of action or mental (non-implemented) moving of speech muscles to say the process intended. When you say, if this angle and this angle then that, what seems like "feels good check" is more like "no braking needed, continue the motion." Learning a2 + b2 = c2 isn't learning the meaning, but mirroring the sequence.<br>
<br>
Mathematical symbols and equations trigger performance of actions (modulate movement) in those that understand the symbols when they have the intention to examine something by said equation. Stepwise, but multi-tiered, sequence. Perform square on a and write result. Perform square on b and write result. Add result one and result two and write sum result. Perform square root on sum result and write final result. This also involves tiered goals. Ultimate goal is final result (find c). Goals within that goal are find a2 and find b2 and find result one plus result two.<br>
<br>
Chess is similar. Ultimate goal is "perform checkmate of opponent king by allowed rules of movement." Other goals are "not allow opponent to perform checkmate on own king," "not allow opponent to accidentally or intentionally make disallowed move," "capture high ranking opponent pieces," "not allow capture own high ranking pieces,"...<br>
<br>
Intelligence is thus largely this ability to have abstract goals and re-implementable motor sequences (which can be stopped at premotor imagery stage or carried into actual action). Sequences can even be taught by sound patterns. We can speak these sound patterns to ourselves (as premotor vocal muscle imagery) to help maintain the memory of, and therefore the implementability of, these sequences. What is speech but a mapping of vocal muscles to sound patterns to premotor or audio imagery of the meaning {and somewhat to eye patterns (letters) and to memories (3D short [10ms] videos) and to finger muscles to write it}? Once you hear a phrase and store it in working memory, you can mull over it to conjure skewers until you are satisfied you have the meaning ie intended movement.<br>
<br>
Speech to others is often the attempt to influence motions.<br>
<br>
For example, hearing the word "stop!" (from movie playing downstairs) the sound maps to your vocal muscles speaking the word, but this 3D cursor is drawing out someone holding up their hand with the action in brain to inhibit anything, if you desire to act upon the command. Or if you're me, you say, "stop what? And why?"<br>
<br>
In the phrase "stop, because," the word "because" is providing reasoning for the value of having this inhibitory filter in this instance. You're more likely to implement if there is friendly vibes coming from the person.<br>
<br>
In the movie phrase "take care of yourself," said condescendingly, the character of speaker is encoded in the rigidity with which he held his body in saying it because he had to deny his innate urge to treat others as himself. He had to blind himself to considering another's condition and feelings and this is by rigidity and not allowing them to influence his ring. Sympathy is allowing another to influence your ring and when a sympathetic person speaks, there is naturalness, fluidity, motion, beauty, not monotony. The allowing or disallowing of ring to vibrate to various concepts is why you can read a person by hearing their voice.<br>
<br>
Each fire of machine gun in movie the sound disturbance on cursor shoots bullet and the bullet travels and meaning conveyed is "be scared, run away." But that meaning is a mapping to muscle options and like I said the drawing of the shooting of bullets. The mapping I can understand, but what is drawing the mental movie? Can also invoke feeling of nationalism of standing up and fighting against the threat for homeland.<br>
<br>
Is it the hippocampus drawing the current mental experience movie with cursor and ring? Is this why HM could not make new memories cause he could not make mental imagery of new events? No.<br>
<br>
So words can map to affecting brain implantation of a thing, "if you accept the command." Words can map to release of dopamine to allow doing of something that you had reticence about. Words can map to release of GABA to inhibit the doing of something that you were going to do. It's if you allow it, but the mapping is there ready at your go. If you implement this as a general rule, now the societal or religious filter is saved in pfc.<br>
<br>
Even cats can learn to map sound patterns to muscles movements and abstract goal. "Give me paw" cat gives paw on hand and gets treat. But "give me paw" isn't a sound they can vocalize, so they can't map it to vocal muscles.<br>
<br>
We can even consider a non-vocal silent doing of punching holes in j channel every 16" and the very quick denial of part of brain saying it needs to be exactly 16" with a tape - quickly denied because only use rivets to lock to panel. But explanation of "only use rivets to lock to panel" not needed if you know that you have a satisfying explanation why not to have to use tape. Quicker to just deny it within 50 ms. Move, squeeze till hole, free, move, squeeze till hole, free... Get to end? Okay, ask this Q: next task? Install it. Have all tools? Climb ladder. "Next task Q" is like, "what larger goal were we under before I started this sub-task of punching holes?" Why these movements? Cause I've learned that it will provide for my needs and desires via $.<br>
<br>
If I premotor "speak" the phrase "I mean what..." over and over, eventually, I key in on the word "I" and have a memory frame of "I vs i." In other words, there's too much meaning to use a skewer on every word every time. That's why you sometimes have to read a sentence several times to understand it fully.<br>
<br>
It's easier to draw a square in your mind by moving a cursor of attention around in a square path than to try to just imagine the whole shape at once from scratch.<br>
<br>
I think usually the rings go counterclockwise as viewed from above.<br>
<br>
HM - hipp can't be the skewer because HM still had all the previously made skewers intact. He just couldn't make or access new skewers. He could have new meaning but just not that also left a memory. The learned meaning became as ephemeral as consciousness fading ink.<br>
<br>
For us normal folks, experience is laid down (and stored) as a helix and can be skewered for reference to compare against newer experiences. But for him, his experience was not getting stored. So, hipp must store the laying of helix (or be somehow involved). Well, not store cause HM had previous memories intact. But, do some process that causes storing in cortex or providing useful ID keys (what all likeness tables should we file this under?). Hipp prolly performs geometrical similarity tests as well as other forms of likeness that are important to us.<br>
<br>
I think with HM, his memories were still getting stored; but, without any trigger tags attached for  when to intersperse them as paint-by-memory frames into ongoing consciousness, they never came up in future consciousness. And if they never come up, it appears you "have no memory" of whatever.<br>
<br>
I think the phrase "storing memories" is stupid. Think of it - all that is stored is a little bit of LTP that would never do a bit of good. Rather, you create a mechanism to refire this group of neurons in this sequence upon a certain likeness table trigger. That is a memory. <br>
<br>
I think they're wrong about the "need sleep to convert to long term memory" because if I experience something, then 3 hours later a similar thing comes up, I always get the frame from earlier that day, just as clear as any memory. But HM didn't. So hipp is doing something IN REAL TIME (or very close to it, lagging only minutes or seconds) to tag real time experience with all the pertinent tags you want. If there is no tag to reignite those neurons, why would they ever reignite (even with ltp) unless exact same stimulus occurred? Perhaps these tags are stored in pfc. A memory frame is something that has to be intentionally recreated from scratch. It would never occur unless the brain intentionally did it. You need to know which neurons in which order give that video snippet consciousness experience, and trigger them as well as you can. Why is it that thc often induces a much more faithful firing of these frame groups? Perhaps slowed rate means video snippet isn't cut off as quickly by pfc? But yea, a memory frame (episodic memory) is a resurrection of a set and order of neural firings (or oscillations?) that would never happen without being forced to happen!<br>
<br>
I still like the idea of pyr being coincidence detector - I fire most when layer 4 says paint and layer 1 says "bingo, you actually do happen to be on the lucky ring this time!" Then non-spec would have to know which neurons are currently on ring (or, better, currently on cursor) and send signal only there. Layer 4 spec does it's own thing all the time, but only big fire of pyr when also on cursor. Massive pyr!<br>
<br>
I think there are two things with memory - the LTP caused by the firings in cortex of experience, and the likeness tables (and degree of relevance or importance) you place it into.<br>
<br>
It seems that nearly always, the second most recent instance (the most recent memory) is grabbed for familiarity, with previous instances further away instances of helix. It's a chain of doings.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the zig zags of a section of helix are what forces replay of memory. Or, perhaps a ring shape is given to every "memory," and commonalities share a particular similarity in the zig zag. And then one memory can have multiple commonalities by multiple patterns inscribed on the ring. So that like a key in theory could be carved with multiple patterns that unlock differring locks...<br>
<br>
Religion just hands people shit that fucks up their relationships. No wonder people are so disagreeable and needlessly, strangely, besuddenly hateful Sunday afternoons after getting an earful of ammo at church. They get loaded up on the deflection of themselves away from their conscience and away from any sense of right and wrong and equity and treating neighbor with respect. They get blinded from the empathy dictated by conscience.<br>
<br>
Could hippocampus be providing where in space?<br>
<br>
Which column tells you where on body; hipp could tell you where in space. Something also tell you where on cup you're touching, and since you know where in space finger is you know where in space cup is. But yea, every object has to have all its skin points placed in space, over and over and over as time progresses, or perhaps just the point(s) on ring over time makes a video that feels like you know all.<br>
<br>
Could 3d skin print SPW be a backup when brain is inhibited by thc, and rings be a further backup, with single 3D cursor the last backup before just shutting off?<br>
<br>
Need to do video on space -<br>
Eye banks, head bank, body bank, absolute bank, with quote from book.<br>
<br>
Why not let hipp be seat of consciousness? After all, all of experience that is memorized (memory) must be included there, even if just in the hands of hipp but actually on cortex.<br>
<br>
Cause hipp is where complex stuff must be reduced to a single layer series processing. CA3 could be future ring, CA1 current ring, DG past ring. Or prolly better each cycle thru draws a ring and then maybe thal gear-changes.<br>
<br>
Could left hipp be ring cursor painting CMW ("semantic mapping," O Keefe), while right hipp be ring cursor simultaneously painting SPW ("spatial mapping")? After all, left side does do language!<br>
<br>
Distance by motion (at what speed) over what duration. This seems to be how brain generates spatial layout.<br>
<br>
What movement (direction) could be by ocular muscles, somehow married to star clusters.<br>
<br>
I mean x y z could be by motion of body (vestibular) and some sort of grid cells; but ringular motion could be by eye saccades evolved internal into "mind."<br>
<br>
Vision (and even just a camera), by geometrical necessity, samples world as collapsed set of spheres. Eye's contribution to psychological space then is to make a series of spheres if it's 2D shell is to be expanded back to 3D for perception. Movement along shell, at any radius, is "ringular." Jumping shells for bumps in radius would be possible. Perhaps cubes are needed for measuring distances.<br>
<br>
Two touching pixels in retina or V1 are actually an angular turn of star cluster spike- ringular. It is a relation of how much angular distance between, but also we care how much straight line distance between (in case the two pixels are separated by 40', mostly in the depth direction). So, to fully map the relation between two voxel in space, we need (theta,phi) angular saccade, its vector direction (theta:phi), <br>
<br>
Where to pupil and where to center of bank which stays fixed. But is mind ever concerned with having to look in two directions? Isn't is always the positions of things RELATIVE TO BANK CENTER ie relative to focal point of foveal gaze? Advantage of this is that all points can be defined by theta, phi, and radius distance. Well, theta and phi together define attitude and radius is magnitude of vector.<br>
<br>
Brain needs to know about rotation and that COMPLETING the rotation of eye, or ball, or whatever, is a periodic thing that comes back and eats its tail! 1° and 359° are very close though not seemingly unless eat tail. Brain needs to know this relationship holds at any attitude, so that angular divisions, in any direction of a perhaps hexagonal field, always easy their tail (creates a sphere when summed). There is a periodicity then in motion.<br>
<br>
Well I really need to get high again to see if center of bank is at focal depth and if an eye movement (not head movement, cause eyes counter move to stay fixed on item of focus!) moves the center of the bank.<br>
<br>
Why is it hard to hold gaze on a point and roll head left or right? It's like buzzy between frames. <br>
<br>
Salience drives saccade in theta-phi, logic drives radius. Perhaps so for rings too.<br>
<br>
Might left half of brain also determine radius for "re"construction of SPW, with right half painting theta-phi colors? Quite possibly, with radius combination with theta-phi making, over sum of all pixels, translucent 3D skins. And as you have always said, CMW (left) draws translucent skins. In this sense, right side <br>
<br>
Could it be that brain draws center of star cluster as being 2' in front of you, even tho it is really at your pupil? After all, if it considers "you" as retina, then center of star cluster is in fact ahead of it. NO.<br>
<br>
I think the main allocentric bank truly is allocentric and the eye gets its own bank. So construct depth (radius) relative to eye bank first, then connect eye bank with allocentric bank and convert the points from one reference frame to another if you desire.<br>
<br>
With an allocentric bank, you can compare between your body and where objects are. Also, stuff in world stays stable since perceptually it is never mapped to eye bank. So movements of eyes add info to stable world.<br>
<br>
Could all the Gaba after fire stuff be a temporal edge in other words shearing off the frame?<br>
<br>
Giving a bank to each eye, head, and allo -> may be a spatial accounting system carried out by left side of brain to track positions. The coloration of perceptual model still done by right side of brain.<br>
<br>
Why does hemp enhance the properties of (usually) the right side of brain? Like when you are high and can tell that actors are play-acting because you can perceive truth and read people.<br>

Found it was British and wealthy and they said a commoner was there. I said your building is crumbling then they believed me. Orientalx and i tried to get into attic and then to roof.<br>
<br>
Maybe brain makes spatial grid cell layout (nope!) then uses lag of hitting each cell as cyclic wave goes over to generate lag and hence reliably convert space to time.<br>
<br>
What if the cortex they all (as a whole) have control to controlling muscles and all together learn by trial and error? How then would memory be done? And the binding consciousness?<br>
<br>
I think when you intend to move your eyes quite a bit right, it divides it into like two or three saccades - these saccade locations are I think precessed spots on cycles of rings, ring cursor going leftward.<br>

<br>
Starting with number five, The Prefrontal Cortex, by Joaquin Fuster, is a great book that explores the unfamiliar territory at the front of the brain. What I took away from this book was the entirely new concept that the brain makes a viewer/interpreter of consciousness which also responds to it. It feels like there is a "you" viewing consciousness because there is — ostensibly in the prefrontal cortex. Fuster explores how high level sensory regions of the brain have fascicular paths to and from the prefrontal cortex. Coming in at fourth place is "My Stroke of Insight," by Jill Taylor. Jill is a neuroscientist who had a severe hemorrhage in her left hemisphere and describes in exquisite detail the hour-by-hour losses to being able to speak what she mentally intended or look for a pattern on a card that she had a clear mental image to match against. She eventually lost all language, math, color, and 3D skills and had to begin again like a newborn in learning these things. Her book is particularly good because it helps to localize where langauge (lexcial ability), color, depth, and anything involving comparisons typically resides in the brain — the left hemisphere. She also decribes how it feels for the left side to shut up for once and let the right side experience a consciousness that simply is, within the present moment, blissful, and loving. At third place is Jeff Hawkin's "A Thousand Brains: A New Theory of Intelligence." This book explores possible mechanisms for doing spatial transforms from one relative axis set to another, for example, when you consider a coffee cup having its own up axis regardless of the orientation at which you hold it. Similarly, each skin or retina sensor has its own orientation outwards vector direction and place within perceptual space. It also explores how sparcity could serve as a very useful brain tool — that there is a group of neurons dedicated to represent some space within perception or some spot on an object, but even if only half or less of the neurons of the group fire, there is still recognition of the thing with very little chance of false positives. Jeff also points out that the cortex is basically a single column repeated thousands of times. If we can figure out the circuitry of one column, we may have figured it all out. Also, since the circuitry appears the same everywhere, the cortex appears to be doing a the same operation of all modalities of sensation and movement. He thinks this is a sort of abstraction of the data that stores all relationships as well as possible. Of course, each column must ostensibly understand every point within perceptual space, and my thought is that the world is made to pass through this fixed perceptual space when you go for a walk. At second place is Rodolpho LLinas' "i of the Vortex." This vortex in this case means the sort of inside-out turn going from thalamus to cortex and back, continually. Llinas believes this cortico-thalamo-cortical recurrant circuit is the seat of consciousness. It makes sense to me, as it is apparently the only thing that brings all sense and motor modalities together in a single, on-going circuit. This circuit he proposes occurs at 40 Hz, but he also mentions a 10 Hz oscillation that the inferior olive starts by itself, and a 2 Hz firing pattern from inferior olive to cerebellum. Llinas explains consciousness as being bound by the pulsate, robotic frequencies, as if they are shouting, "Move, move, move," like an internalized version of the first flagella of early life. He gives an example of how trans-cranial stimulation made him move his foot inwards medially, whilst giving the sensation that he had decided to do it. He defines free will as those times when you know what your body is going to do next. Finally, at first place is Jeff Hawkins again, with his older book "On Intelligence." In it, he beautifully points out how behavior and sensation are made to happen, and then get recorded so that new behaviors and sensations can be predicted. That consciousness is largely made up of novel experience, memory, and prediction. This is copacetic to me because it fits in with ring theory — that there is an ever growing helix which continually moves from present into future in a predictive, but malleable, fashion, and which, by patterns, paints both sensation and action in one as a 3D consciousness video. More is available in my book "Rings of Fire: How the Brain Makes Consciousness," which I am not ranking as it is my own book.<br>
Is consciousness a hallucination of cells that they are actually a whole entity? Does brain only draw helix, and hallucination is painting a story within the rings? Or does brain only draw time fluctuation, and hallucinates ring position, attitude, speed, and movie story that fits within? If so, what gives a cell consciousness? The dna somehow?<br>
<br>
Going from one cell to a multi cell organism, did it divy up time and give a tiny slot to each cell (or specialized region/category of cells? And maybe even a tiny SPW slot at 50 Hz (maybe divide one cycle into 20 slots - 1 ms each) and a bigger CMW slot at 10 Hz (with four slots per cycle, this would be 25 ms each). <br>
<br>
Consciousness is the greatest puzzle. A fun challenge.<br>

Dale's film noir:<br>

<br>
It's almost like the brain system has forced cells to participate in a larger whole whether they want or not. They're going to fire if they are tickled enough by depolarizing tickles. Ie they are going to cause movements of muscles but the control of muscles oscillating is now (due to APs system) at behest of wired conglomeration of all the cells. <br>
<br>
I mean a cell might could still contribute if it has access to closing or opening gates, but only to the movement of the whole. Well if things break down, <br>
<br>
Color is a WHAT. It only has "full bodied beauty" because that is the MEANING painted in the story by the zig zags of helix to demonstrate you know the "what" of what color a thing is.<br>
<br>
The meaning is done, but it fits within the zig zag of the helix. Perhaps the helix isn't actually "painting" anything in the strictest sense, but rather STORY MEANINGS are associated with the things and hence kind of hallucinated. But nonetheless pretty dad gum accurate! So that it never has to do geometry - only do the same pattern of zigging and zagging every time you want to see you smelling a gardenia a certain way.<br>
<br>
The driving helix is only a helix in the story of intended meaning. To the muscles it is just a driving temporally varying code.<br>
<br>
The temporal oscillations or firings is the last unknown language to crack.<br>
<br>
Three pinhole cameras, with right infrared wavelength sensors? Or 5? Reading sphere shells. How to reset depth? <br>
<br>
Could also make a small two-pinholes sphere camera (1" diameter?) for regular photography of 3D scene which could be made a ball photo or star cluster photo. Could screw at seam for building or cleaning.<br>
<br>
Actually, if sphere, have to have tons of pinholes but each must be a tube. Or just stick to two pinhole hemispheres back to back and cylindered.<br>
<br>
Sound doesn't vibrate the printhead. The brain "allows" (better, causes) it to look like sound vibrates printhead to show the sound, but really even the vibration of printhead is created by brain as a tool to show sound. Similarly with inertia and touch. They don't surprise the printhead - it's a feature for showing inertia, not a bug.<br>
<br>
There is a method for making 3D topo surfaces similar pattern of zig zag when similar in 3D structure. So brain does math somewhere to come up with 3D skins, ostensibly around left occipital. Left would be good location for flow because comparing one time ring to another to extract 3D distances for topo maps. Maybe that is why it uses time to paint sounds as a spatial dimension.<br>

So maybe right thal-cor is drawing current ring and right hipp is reading it and showing to left hipp, and left thal-cor is refreshing old rings and predicting next ring.<br>
<br>
Would ACh be providing ring attitude, shape, and speed? What is the language of this temporal code?<br>
<br>
If ring is all, then ACh need only provide freq ("speed") and perhaps attitude. Then hipp or cortex can zig-zagify it to their hearts' content!<br>

Never less than 4 bars on rack at all times.<br>

"Head direction cells" in the mammillary bodies are more like "world direction cells," since to consciousness the head never turns (except when eyes locked on some object). When eyes move, head in reality doesn't turn but to consciousness it does turn relative to bank being considered stationary. When eyes move, the bank "moves" within the story (of consciousness), but since it considers itself stationary (really is stationary), the relative movement is: story rotates CCW (viewed from above) about vertical axis going thru Brad's pupil while Brad within story turns his eyes to right.<br>
<br>
If I turn my eyes only, the direction my head points relative to bank center changes! But for my eyes, I am always looking at the center of the bank by definition.<br>
<br>
Apparently I'm wrong. Head direction cells appear to be actually head direction (within world). I'm not wrong tho about how consciousness draws it.<br>
<br>
I wonder if there are eye direction cells for left eye and right eye. I guess there'd have to be. Maybe not allocentric, but certainly relative to head it must be built for we are conscious of our eyes' directions.<br>
<br>
What if there are 100-1,000 tiny "piano key object slots" for cursor as it goes along ring/helix, just as there are slots for rings, and flow is the past rings or fire of ring is from past cursor locations still fading? Or just 4-6 key slots?<br>

What transform needs to be applied to pupil star cluster so that it becomes a star cluster 2' away from your pupil but paints the same SPW scene? Have this, and have which vectors group in planes and you can paint consciousness by rings which expand to 2D pictures (still viewed from self?) which over time a series of these picture planes in different spots at different times makes the movie. Prolly why it doesn't consciousify V1 is cause it hasn't allo'd the cluster to 2' ahead yet.<br>
<br>
Anywho, maximal CHANGE for light rays perpendicular to direction of movement of cluster like think moving cluster forwards. ZERO CHANGE for light rays in forwards backwards direction. Over enough distance, rays close to parallel to forwards (and short radius away) may end up close to parallel to backwards. Things very very far away won't hardly change but maximal change for them will still be at perpendicular.<br>
<br>
So for points on a sphere of radius r from pupil, moving cluster forwards by r, the very nearly forwards light ray pointed to a place that now requires rotation by nearly 90° in its offset direction for new center to point to it. Points that were 90° require an additional 45°. Points that were 179° (nearly backwards) are now 179.5°.<br>

Thalamus passes ring to cortex and cortex regions paint movie imagery thereupon. (?) FILLER: What if thalamus LINKS UP the 3D cursor's location within copy of bank in EACH cerebral cortex COLUMN? A lot of redundancy, but then consciousness would be solved.<br>

I wonder if bright lines of light coming through side of window with shades down is harder to map to "stay put" as eye microsaccades but looking at guitar close by and head turned at a bit of an angle. Like the new cells in retina see a bunch of light all of the sudden and maybe have to burst or something and so that line appears to be rapidly alternating in spatial location while guitar stays put. And I've just woken up.<br>

Consciousness is like the control panel for flying (guiding) the body. The pilot doesn't see the real world, but does see this dash board helix with 3D video meaning. Topy of any sort with real world is then meaningless except that you could measure the usefulness or precision "topy" of how well the dashboard models the outside world based on number/degree of error flags. But I don't think error flags like cerebellum is sending. I think error flags by seeing that your avatar moved his arm the opposite way of what you wanted with flipped glasses on. The whole time "you" are looking at the story (consciousnesses) and learning to change circuitry based on the meaning seen within. Like left brain is looking at future (goal) and past (or perhaps better, present seemingly). Or PFC has a "goal" ("move left hand to left") and when it sees avatar's right hand moving right it must make sense of it ("I'll create a 'new left hand' and a new 'left,' and call the other ones the old ones"). Or the backwards bike. These things take weeks to learn how to put a ("but flipped") filter in front of every muscle command; and, prior to that, to check if needed ("am I on backwards bike or wearing flipped glasses, or just regular bike and or regular glasses?").<br>
<br>
I bet it does just get the helix and learns to properly hallucinate the 3D video (?) that would fit the pattern of zigs/zags on the helix. It "learns to see," just as with those flipped glasses!<br>
<br>
I can see why there would be a robotic "go go go" internalized, but still, intention to avoid hurt I don't understand why "go go go" would cause that. What is the drive of self preservation? Is it robotic, or metaphysical?<br>
<br>
Consciousness does appear to (usually) be 2D (sampled over say 50-100 ms). The meaning is 3D video, but at an instant (1 ms) you reduce to 0D (point). Over a little time (10 ms) you have both a line (1D) and a curve (2D plane). Over more time (1,000 ms) you have a helix with 3D movie meaning "fitting" inside (3D). Consciousness can sometimes print in 3D (3D trapezoidal puzzle pieces), even sampled at as little as about 20-50 ms.<br>
<br>
So glasses, prolly really see world flipped left-right. You LEARN to map "new right" to moving left hand leftwards. So it is the muscle movements that need filter, not the seeing. It's like the seeing is taken as accurate and as reference point whatever the orientation.<br>
<br>
Maybe instead of "go go go," the robotic pulsate thing is "maintain homeostasis, maintain homeostasis, maintain homeostasis." Or, "preserve self, preserve self, preserve self." Maybe the pulsate thing itself has inertia, "go out come back, go out come back, go out come back." Maybe the fact that it "prefers" (natural resonance) a certain frequency of "pulse, pulse, pulse" is the "homeostasis" and deviations are bad and so danger to self is presented as deviations.<br>
<br>
I think why size doesn't matter (small room vs all the way to moon in preception) is cause it's just a certain spoke resolution. Paint "on the sphere shell" that it's supposed to be a long ways by shrinking size of moon to what relative size it'd be. Kinda like how real high frequency sound like 5,000-20,000 Hz is repped by tininess of amplitude on cave wall. Decreasing (small step) solid angle portend equals huge increase in distance (radius).<br>
<br>
The moments you "space out" are times your mind's eye goes off to side looking at rings from vantage point that shows imagination imagery.<br>

What if the expectations of consciousness as I walk thru garage routinely out to car are just the agglomerations of invariants plus over time?<br>
<br>
So after my love fest with pinholes, I guess we can say two reasons they are not practical - one the "circle of confusion" is larger than desired pixel size, even at optimal trade-off hole size of 0.33mm. At smaller size holes (0.07mm), Airy Disc of George Airy takes over (diffraction limited). At larger size holes (1-2mm), there is enough cone (and stray rays?) to muddy the pixels up. So, a pinhole can NEVER be as accurate as we'd like. BUT, the other issue for humans is low light inside and at night, so a lens really is a must even though it is messy. It provides better resolution by a lot than a pinhole. Too bad there's nothing that can measure pinpoints in space.<br>

If we really want to be honest, it doesn't even make sense that a cell would be able to "know" what's going on at each synapse (reducing consciousness from global brain level to cellular level doesn't seem to "fix" the spatial problem [the spatial problem of something at a location cannot know what is happening at another location]). Spatial separation problem as opposed to problem of how perceptual space (even if just in meaning) is made. Does consciousness somehow use PROBABILITIES and since these can be interpreted, it gives rise to will?<br>
<br>
Could it be that even will and choices are a chemical equation designed by evolution to favor (cause) good choices, like with the Aplysia, where he thot he figured out he didn't need to pay attention to benign stimuli, but really a just-so-happens patterned increase or decrease of neurotransmitter resulted in more or less axons growing or whatever? And he claimed it as "his decision"? After all, first time high it felt like that - that you are the sum experience of the reactions that go on within and you are kind of "raped" by them into experiencing life in the way it chooses.<br>
<br>
Maybe it is cortex responding to the MEANING of the patterns. Does MEANING fade fairly quickly, like by definition? Does it flow directionally away by definition or by bank kick out? Like what things change in story OR if nothing changes then the change of where your mind's eye is focusing OR both. Perhaps there must always be change for consciousness to be maintained.<br>
<br>
It is pretty crazy that blind-from-birth braille readers read braille beginning (cortex wise) from the visual cortex and for sure the left fusiform gyrus ("Visual Word Form Area"). Altho sensory will be activated, it appears visual cortex may conjure out mental imagery even without any visual input at all (and without I guess the heightened 40 Hz waves, huh?). That's in keeping with me saying that I observe CMW at 10 Hz and it coming from left hemisphere. Even if they are reading the braille with left hand ("should be right cortex"), the left fusiform gyrus lights up the most.<br>
<br>
What if the "single basic algorithm" of the cortex IS the story/ring? Each column needs to "know" WHERE it's drawing (where in perceptual space is the cursor "3D brush"?) and WHAT it's drawing/contributing to (what 3D movie is playing within the helix?)<br>
<br>
Could they all just be saying where the cursor is relative to them? Like each column on the body says what distance it currently is to the cursor. Or better, each column on the body calculates and says where on the bank it is. I think consciousness (story drawn) is report of "that is" or "that which is." I don't think consciousness causes hand to move. Rather, "that which is" is painted as a means of seeing HOW to move by seeing real-time feedback. Hence why it is so dedicated to truth (if you know something is something you can't unsee the truth and see whatever funny thing you first thought it was). You're looking at "consciousness the real-time report and analysis" and deciding how to act. (But the looking and "deciding" are drawn into the story a split moment later so it looks real time). <br>
<br>
You "turn off the news" when you go to sleep, but you don't cease to exist (mentally), you just take it extremely easy for awhile and contemplate, often in nonsensical feelings and partial geometries.<br>
<br>
High try:<br>
Does moving eyes move bank?<br>
Open and close eyes how is visual 3D field done with mere rings?<br>
Move iPhone speaker song around - do vibrating rings move with phone? Are rings tiny for that speaker?<br>
How does the letter s like seashore sound? That's 8,000 Hz.<br>
<br>
Stencils (angled) of man kicking soccer ball over time would be cool. Then draw helix (with zigs zags) at slower freq connecting. Or even those stencils coming out from phone.<br>
<br>
If every column of cortex does calculate or know where the cursor is at a given moment, then that frees a single column (and therefore every column) to be able to paint ANYWHERE the cursor may be! Now if it has something to contribute at a certain time, it does so knowing it did so at the right location in perceptual space for its sensor within space! Cyclic firing of one region would be the ring hitting the same voxel over and over and needing painted each cycle.<br>
<br>
Would the left fusiform gyrus (Visual Word Area) then be responsible for guiding large (well, small, but since ring rarely moves off its path axially, seemingly large) spatial (axial) deviations of the cursor so as to draw shapes and letters? And hipp or past memories on cortex when triggered is like reverberations of similar geometrical deviations? ("Skewers")<br>
<br>
It may be you don't need the whole letter, just as you don't need all the letters in a word, to recognize as ring may just draw upper half of "a" so that ring can remain a single line (paint what you can with a single boundary shape and let that trigger stuff). Try drawing this.<br>
<br>
The 3D Cursor of Consciousness <br>
<br>
I think at the end of the day, the only "single basic algorithm" the cortex columns COULD be doing is spatial: first knowing where the cursor is relative to the bank, and second possibly being able to declare where the column sensor is currently on the bank if doing a 3D skin print.<br>
<br>
When "it" sees "leg" you need to program a microresponse of "leg" to keep "understanding" going (??).<br>
<br>
Let's abandon how it does it for a second. This cursor is all of consciousness. Therefore, the neurons that are firing in regions of cortex must be that cursor from moment to moment. Therefore, the neurons have a SPATIALLY MOVING meaning in the story because it is the printhead of that story. I.e., going from 0 ms to 10 ms to 20 ms, each new set of firing neurons represents a new spatial spot along a ring (usually). Probably the 3D prints are some wonky looking cerebral firing pattern but let's ignore them for a second. Also, the more they bunch together cyclically, the more likely you have sheared off rings that may also be walking. But let's ignore that too for a second. Under normal circumstances, brain fires that is a 3D point in perceptual space. Brain fires again that is a "phasically advanced" spot on ring. Brain fires again, a further point (within perception) along ring.<br>
<br>
For short time durations (30 ms), you are usually talking about the same area in perceptual space.<br>
<br>
What we could maybe do to read brain signals then is to assign each temporal moment a spatial unknown 3D point (x,y,z) (better, phase, radius, attitude) (AND bank point?) that we want to solve for, looking for cyclic repeats that may help us narrow it down, and looking for that sequentially it sums in  (perceptual, but also geometrical) space in a nice ring arc. We could also look for where that column's sensor is on body, and which other columns are SIMULTANEOUSLY ACTIVATED along with it to try to deduce a first point. Once you've got your foot in the door perhaps it would become easy to read. Finally, try to increase resolution of understanding of helix to the point of seeing the zigs and zags, and then try to deduce the language of consciousness therefrom. What zigs and zags do what. Well, we know that letter zigs and zags are the language of reading within perception, but how does it spell out the axial geometrical letter shape disturbances?<br>
<br>
Maybe cortex just keeps (ice cube) bank going against (water level) bank so that the (intersection) ring attitude is already a given. (Could this be the 100 Hz traveling cortical waves keeping ring plane going?) Then only phase and radius (better than radius, say ring shape) are needed to be specced. Maybe flow is the movement of (ice cube) bank that is superfluous to story.<br>
<br>
Anyway, to read the brain, you'd want to divy up into all the columns (all 10,000 or however many visual pixel columns, all the places on the body columns in somatosensory, and certainly the fusiform gyri, etc.) and take a "movie" recording of say 30 minutes of the person doing a multitude of tasks, preferably high seeing rings, and record the movie of the tasks along with the neural firings. And these firings need 5 ms temporal resolution or better (1 ms would be ideal). Then, during the time, ask him to point out where cursor is drawing rings and record in video, timed to neural firings. Then, studiously examine both videos to try to provide a perceptual place to each ms of video/neural firing and from there maybe you can have Rosetta stone of the brain. Each firing, tho ostensibly linked in physical space, also should be examined for the sense column it came from. When the person hears speech, ostensibly auditory cortex, Wernicke, angular, Broca, and premotor will ALL be contributing to drawing ring.<br>
<br>
If sound (up to 1,000 Hz at least) is encoded by frequency of firing (along path to cochlear nucleus), then what encodes amplitude of sound.<br>
<br>
Tiny temporal variations could be the invariant that is same at any attitude.<br>
<br>
Beavis and butthead is great cause it pushes back against the soul killing "produce!" narrative of our society (a good thing to produce but you need a break every once in awhile!).<br>
<br>
What if every column in cortex has a copy of the bank, and the 100Hz traveling cortical wave hooks up to the right spatial point within each column to say "3D cursor is here right now!" Or even in this rare cases, "translucent skin is made of these points within bank right now!" I think that is extremely satisfying. Maybe each column can affect the cursor how it wants for the one millisecond it is included in a group. Or maybe it doesn't have to be included in a group - maybe all columns are free to move the thing by selecting a slightly different point in bank. But each column would have to have the same bank and have each point mapped correctly in joining hands with all other columns. <br>
<br>
Then, fovea looking at all every pixel as a baby it builds up the bank first as a set of x,y locations (frontoparallel) (better, theta, phi). Then, left hemisphere can LEARN that there is this thing called depth and let the bank now become a 3D structure with lots of VOXELS of where the 3D cursor of your focal point in vision can look. It saves SOMETHING WITHIN THAT COLUMN to rep "now I'm looking at this voxel in the bank" and over time adds shapes and forms and faces and scenes with the help of higher columns and VOILA! you have a means of CREATING the bank!!!!!<br>
<br>
In this way, it may be that the central function of a cortical column is to LINK with other things when body and eye and arm were in a CERTAIN CONFIGURATION and store a random pattern to ID that particular configuration. For eyes, it is naturally a 3D bank.<br>
<br>
Then, if eyes want to move "HERE" to "THIS PARTICULAR VOXEL" within bank, all they have to do is fire the random neuron pattern saved for the last time they were LOOKING THAT DIRECTION and it will TRIGGER the muscles of Frontal Eye Fields to also "go to that point".<br>
<br>
Then, the 41,253 square degree thing (really, more like minute subdivisions) you change attitude by drawing attention to whatever attitude you WANT and retrigger neurons all across brain related to THAT POINT/ATTITUDE within each of their copies of the bank.<br>
<br>
To say that each cerebral cortical column has a copy of the raw bank (matrix volume of perceptual voxel points) is really not a preposterous claim. Basically, all I'm saying is that every column needs to be comfortable with the spatial environment of perception and be able to refer to any point therein and do operations of rotation and scaling by comparing bank against bank, etc.<br>
<br>
If anything, it feels more like, "how could it ever have been any other way?!" now that I've had the idea.<br>
<br>
I still like the idea of the cerebellum holding the info for x, for y, and for z of objects and body positions to be hung on the bank. LTD (long term depression) of Purkinje Cells means long term LEAK from deep cerebellar nuclei back to cerebrum of the info to make skin forms of body and mental objects which can continually go to cortex and slightly stimulate it so as to say, "Hey, these might be good skins to consider since we've used them before!" And it is perceptual realm spatial skins - a sort of "bank"!<br>
<br>
People say, "why did we evolve consciousness? It serves no function!" Jeez, really? Well for one, doesn't the fact that "consciousness, the dashboard" is so beautiful give the prefrontal cortex viewer more incentive to want to stay alive? Everybody and every animal wants to keep living — why? For one cause consciousness the experience is downright amazing.<br>
<br>
This theory posits that 100% of the experience of consciousness (including the qualia of sensing incoming data, internal contemplation, and outgoing motor; and also the memory storage, prediction, and learning) are all driven by the 3D zig-zag patterns of a sort of helix that grows in perceptual space, and fades over about a second, providing a 1-second time window. This helix gives rise to what we consider to be a 3D consciousness movie, replete with our own avatar. This perceptual space, though seemingly the same as the real world, is actually a "meaning-space," not a real space, which is why the zigs and zags of the helix can be "the same as" the 3D video. Also, since perceptual space is not a real space like the universe's space, when you take a walk, consciousness paints the world as moving against you. The fact that you are walking your brain down the trail doesn't matter, since movement cannot be felt. Your brain paints in the feeling of moving down the trail in the 3D movie story meaning, since it gets movement info from the vestibular organs, but this feeling of moving is experienced because it paints it into the story, not simply because you moved. If it were otherwise, a person with no vestibular organs should still feel movement when walking down a trail, but they don't. To try to grasp this real-time growing helix that creates consciousness, think of reading. When you read text, the 3D cursor drawing this helix may follow the text, and "split the earth" with the zigs and zags sometimes actually following parts of the letter like above the letter becomes one side of earthquake, and below the letter becomes another side, and the chasm created can be "looked down" to see a "skewer" of useful memories of similar zig-zag with the layers of ground representing further and further back memories. These memories are why you get a sense of familiarity and understanding for words or for any abstract commonality.<br>

<br>
There's two parts of the brain — the cerebrum and the cerebellum. We could call them the big brain and the little brain. Even though the little brain is small, it's the older one. The little brain looks like spaghetti noodles, while the big one looks like jello!<br>
<br>
These two brains talk to each other. The little brain sends signals from Purkinje cells in its cortex down to its center, called the deep cerebellar nuclei. Then, the signals go to the thalamus and on to the cortex of the big brain.<br>
<br>
The big brain sends signals from Pyramidal cells in layer 5 of its cortex down to the Pontine nuclei in the brainstem, and then on to granule cells in the cerebellar cortex and finally all the way to the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum.<br>
<br>
It sounds like a lot, but it's basically just two brains connected in a big circle.<br>
<br>
There's also a structure in the brainstem, called the inferior olive, that sends signals to the cerebellum, to those same Purkinje cells.<br>
<br>
Here's a diagram. Get really nitty gritty with it, if you want. But we'll come back to it later.<br>
<br>
Let me show you what's going on in the cerebellar cortex with those Purkinje cells, looking really close.<br>
<br>
The power line looking things are parallel fibers coming off the granule cells. These are carrying the signals from the cerebrum. The neon green are climbing fibers, coming from the inferior olive — these have a powerful zap! The black cells are Purkinje cells, and you can see they have wide, flat branching dendrites to collect signals.<br>
<br>
Let me give you another look. Here, the red are the granule cells and parallel fibers. Green are the Purkinje cells. Blue are another one called Bergmann glia cells. You might be able to see little green roots coming down off the Purkinje cells - those are it's axons, carrying signals to the deep cerebellar nuclei.<br>
<br>
Well, here's the nitty gritty diagram I promised. What we have here is 40 Hz signals coming from cerebrum, 2 - 12 Hz coming from inferior olive, and a complete patterning of increases and decreases in frequency from deep cerebellar nuclei back to cerebrum. <br>
<br>
What if the cerebellum is positioning everything just right inside perceptual space, with a basic snapshot of these translucent positioning skins getting taken and sent to the cerebrum every 2 - 12 times a second? When inferior olive and granule neurons fire on a Purkinje cell at the same time, it gets shut up, which they call long term depressed. It stops firing, but since it's signal was inhibitory anyway on the deep cerebellar nuclei, it ends up being a good thing because it means higher frequency signals can get sent to cerebrum.<br>
<br>
If you have Parkinson's, or have gotten really high, or have been without sleep, you might have noticed that things got jerky, maybe even like you could see the snapshots, and maybe their alignment with the real world was lagging. That might be the whole point of the cerebellum — to make these snapshots of 3D skins of your body or of things you're thinking about or even of the world around you. When you're sober, the snapshots line up perfectly, and you don't notice them. But when things get off whack, you see them. We could even call these a fundamental part of perception — the "frames" of consciousness. <br>
<br>
Think of it like this. The cerebellum has these little men — layouts of your body, looking from 3 different angles. They could be mapping the 3D spots where each part of your body and environment is each moment. They could be making a perceptual space. Then, when you walk somewhere, you pull the world through your perceptual space. It's like you are tethered to your cage of perceptual space.<br>
<br>
To sum up, your cerebellum seems to make or align 3D skins with the imagery of your cerebrum. Without it, we lose the ability to think or move with precision within perceptual space.<br>
