<h1>Raw Journals: Trip 9</h1>

<p>The following are notes from 10/5/22 (taking a bite of a legal delta-0 hemp gummy) and extra filler added later in contemplation. The reason there are typos is because I swiped it all out with my finger on my iPhone as quickly as I could and didn't want to lose thoughts by going back when iPhone keyboard was being stupid. Some of the things I can no longer tell exactly what word I was going for, so I'm leaving the text alone. I think the most philosophical thought can be gotten from it that way. I add filler here and there to help provide context/meaning. These notes should be taken in a philosophical way - I write everything down that comes to mind without checking it; then I can check and consider the things later. Thus, statements that appear as fact may be me looking at something a certain way and trying it on, but it doesn't mean that I fully agree with it. These notes are more like grasping to try to understand consciousness and just things in general.<br>

Consciousness doesn't have to draw or connect to all body to worry about blood pressure etc- just enough to SEE the MEANING.so you fly sideways left arm up thru coronal ring in rightwards direction but stay fixed there to ring. The you that is viewing this story (you as consciousness) moves around as eye i true i and little I is a character in the story.  Feed is going thru really fast - Flow. The center ring is the eye that views consciencesness the Reality (Filler: views consciousness, the whole of it, the sum and substance). Yea vantage angle is i and I looking at same ring diff angles. Yea from bank. <br>
<br>
Filler : head movement shifted from one frame to next, but "world" stayed put.<br>
<br>
I think eye isn't even drawn but rather the inertia color experienced there projects as eye distance and angle in our geometrical minds when reflected.<br>
<br>
You always side with this guy (I) when sober even though there's more to see at (i). You pay attention to gaze direction of man I sober, but real you still moves around and YOU feel the qualia.<br>
<br>
If time alone, any part of cerebrum can contribute to mesh (and to consciousness) if it knows the proper time and the story that is being painted (and ring shape, position, attitude, which can all be given by illumination of ring on bank -- and compare that bank against a "stable" bank?). Perhaps why you can't experience consciousness of others is because electrical separation between heads, and if they were joined you would sense. Or, instead of mesh, perhaps resonant 40 Hz draws consciousness, and you must reach that zenith to be included. Perhaps narrowing Q brings an item into maximal attention, and then decohere to let it go. In this way, you can still be mildly attentive to lesser stimuli where you can quickly move to bring maximal attention if needed or desired.<br>
<br>
Could ring shape radius (inwards amount) in be postcession? No cause ring doesn't grow. Unless it's read somewhere?<br>
<br>
Does DNA read? Doubt it.<br>
<br>
Is it more time that can feel rather than matter or charge? But still, gap without feeling.<br>
<br>
Is it frequencies that somehow feel?<br>
<br>
Forces on matter do not give rise to consciousness (b/c gaps); possibly waves of charge (APs) do not give rise to consciousness (all or nothing and there's sometimes gaps). So what is even left? What would cause a feeling of inertia or a ring shape with a feed? Is it an interaction between moving CSF matter (v. unlikely!) and EM waves from charge waves in periaquiductal grey? Funny they'd be allocentric (doesn't really comport).<br>
<br>
EM waves can move matter. So you can observe a phenomenon that looks like what happens to make the feeling of consciousness, but this phenomenon <br>
<br>
One specific mesh (in cerebrum) could be an island unto itself, and that mesh (you) turning on and off would feel like starts and stops of consciousness. Like power grid. This would make sense as splitting corpus callosum can result in 2 consciousnesses. If such a person could take gummies and see what each half sees of ring attitude to see if same attitude, then maybe center thalamus matrix does attitude. There could be shorthand IDs for attitudes. Could each cerebral column have its own bank, and then multitude provides even more power? Could cerebellar cortex PCs be columns of banks too, but for selecting a 2D plane from?<br>
<br>
Could cerebellar part of consciousness be rings (usually not loud enough to pay mental mind eye attention to, but still felt), and cerebrum skins?<br>
<br>
Mi sol mi la mi sol<br>
<br>
To draw all encompassing story there is always on hand the model of the real world at every moment. The brain has this. How it shunts to consciousness I donâ€™t know.<br>
<br>
Sea squirt 200 neurons.<br>
Eagle telescopic lens?<br>
Inertia of falling (cresting hill) all day - astronauts, but get used to it.<br>
<br>
Foxp2 gene mutation humans have. Struggle to talk without it.<br>
<br>
Primitive accounting of barley for city states.<br>
Then, use image of barley to mean the sound <br>
Barley "sheh"<br>
Rebus principle.<br>
Barley milk "sheh ga" (sort of a pun) to mean something else with compound sound.<br>
Catfish chisel<br>
Nar mer<br>
Sound out name of first Egyptian king.<br>
Also warsh <br>
Heiroglyphs<br>
Duck can be duck or the sound of the duck <br>
Daughter is "sought"<br>
Saw for duck, half French bread "tuh"<br>
Rebus -> in Egypt or Mesopotamia <br>
Writing -> Sounds of a language are represented <br>
Chinese characters are symbolized pictures<br>
Confused? Use determinatives. 214 classifier signs; most have one. Tell whether phonetic or image meant.<br>
Mayan glyphs use Rebus principle too.<br>
Some letters for sounds representations; some for image representations.<br>
Serabit script - ba alit goddess of Canaanites - start of alphabet - 1850 bc<br>
One first use was counting or accounting barley.<br>
<br>
Just as you can move anywhere in the visual field you desire and know where or how to move; likewise with language skewers you can go to any memory of a skewer meaning or any skewer meaning. <br>
<br>
The solid ramp up closes off hearing slower thought. Sleep is kind of like a trance. Why don't your eyes read these letters until after about 30-60 seconds? So maybe the dissociated frames at 10 Hz alpha waves pizza slice then water slide then whatever is to silence meditation so as to remain easily distractable and hence "conscious" (awake) of world in that way. Maybe after the pizza slice stuff then inputs from real world start to take over. Does gamma ramp up follow alpha ramp up and it's why you can't read small letters right upon waking? (Or is it just dry coating of eye?) So that you can still see color and big stuff with alpha, but gamma is needed for fine detail of fovea? But you awake (become conscious of real world) prior to either of these - is this theta ramp up?<br>
We know gamma waves go or stop with opening or closing of eyes. But usually you immediately see fine detail, whereas sleep to wake transition you don't. Could fine detail require beta waves and they don't ramp up until 30+ seconds?<br>
<br>
Show sleep spindles to awake in book!<br>
