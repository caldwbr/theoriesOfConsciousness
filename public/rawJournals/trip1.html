<h1>Raw Journals: Trip 1</h1>

<p>The following are notes from 1/1/22 (taking two legal hemp gummies) and extra filler added later in contemplation. The reason there are typos is because I swiped it all out with my finger on my iPhone as quickly as I could and didn't want to lose thoughts by going back when iPhone keyboard was being stupid. Some of the things I can no longer tell exactly what word I was going for, so I'm leaving the text alone. I think the most philosophical thought can be gotten from it that way. I add filler here and there to help provide context/meaning. These notes should be taken in a philosophical way - I write everything down that comes to mind without checking it; then I can check and consider the things later. Thus, statements that appear as fact may be me looking at something a certain way and trying it on, but it doesn't mean that I fully agree with it. These notes are more like grasping to try to understand consciousness and just things in general.<br>
  <br>
Rings of Fire - The Brain Waves Behind Perception <br>
Rings of Fire - The Brain Waves Most Fundamental to Perception<br>
Rings of Fire - The Brain Wave Saccades Behind Consciousness<br>
Rings of Fire - The Saccadic Brain Waves of Consciousness<br>
<br>
Neuronal Correlates of Consciousness nature.com ITT theory - "hot zone" above and temporal to Vc is where things are mapped (?) to memories and consciousness and color arise- f with this you f with consciousness - f with the pfc and you f with a person's societal norms but not his consciousness.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Universe - "I color myself when I can see myself" (via brain, representation of universe in miniature in firing patterns model?)<br>
<br>
Memory filtered by phone screen (iPhone, Droid DNA, like tower of oldest to newest)<br>
<br>
Every pattern of various muscle activity in the pushing out arm signal gets included together - no complicated mish mash of tasks. <br>
<br>
Memory by number writing sheet and periods were way bigger and funner.<br>
<br>
What if they depopulate us and then give it back bit by bit - technology and knowledge - with a rewritten history that always starts from the point of chaos to dark ages and depopulation? And grafts onto a fake past before that.<br>
<br>
Filler: The thing below is referring to how light passing through 2 polarized sheets is blocked when they are 90°, yet light reappears through all three when adding a third polarizer at 45° in between the other two.<br>
Maybe the 3 sheet thing it stays a quantum wave (ambiguous) through both sheets at 45°<br>
- would be a good diagram 2 sheets no light 3 sheets light.<br>
<br>
Memory of clothing filtered by shirt front pockets for hands<br>
<br>
Memory by color and shape of tip of pencil - tip of pencil, flintstone orange and black zigzag shirt, etc. Why____felt sorry for you high cause you would say "like so and so" from earlier ("childish") memory and she thot it was stupid.<br>
<br>
Approach speed of light it is drain vortex but like super thin tube like foveal cone cells response pattern. Does it cross to counterspace at tiniest spot?<br>
<br>
You see 180° horizontal, so there must be not 1/6th, but more - 1/2 (by 1/4 sphere vertical) - if spatial and true in brain firing layout.<br>
<br>
Filter by two colors yellow (you mean purple?) and green - LSU (others)<br>
<br>
Filter by anything - it's like my app - they all share the codes- every customer listed on one table, every project listed on another, the grand scheme has all - search by universal id with all tags of any object. Everything known about any object or motion or function or property - color, shape, movement, weight - it all is kept together by SCARCE neural code patterns. If the grand scheme item has your search criteria code as part of the properties of one of its constituents, voila! <br>
<br>
I think when you "filter by" (such as head/crown of queen in chess) sober, you brain jumps to and LOCKS ONTO first match (castle wall roof), and you have to start search again with ", but not castle wall roof" added to query. High, you see more of the back-going list of matches (it inhibits the "lock onto first result" mechanism, allowing you to BREAK habits of false positive fear response when threat no longer present, or BREAK the weird social responses you were taught in a cult, etc., because you don't have to lock on and use that. Also, memories, you don't have to lock onto the memory of the memory of the memory which is old and crusty and worn and bare-bones- you can actually link to the ORIGINAL memory and re-enjoy it, almost identically to when it first happened say 30 years ago!).<br>
<br>
Filter by smokey smell - smokey coat reminds of saidlas smokey fire in fireplace. <br>
<br>
Filter function, though not as reliable as app in providing every match every time, does have an advantage of being able to find things "like" the query, not only identical matches.<br>
<br>
Maybe when you're high, you can well enough visualize stuff mentally in closed eye visual cortex that it's producing these pattern IDs for say a "spatial frequency" lookin ass doorway and then hot zone naturally says yes, these memories associated with that. But when you're sober, eyes closed your Vc really ain't producing crap and ain't really slowed enough to conjure up anything in order for it to filter by. <br>
<br>
Ain't so straight line (like even book admitted)- it's more biological in figuring out data. Not like  certain neurons know they are 14° left angle line firers. But you do see that, so how?<br>
<br>
Is there a neural code for every neuron or maybe for a spaced out group of neurons to serve as a certain digit in code? Hence so many interconnections? And it's like hot zone is saying, "these guys firing (tilted line here, square shape here with orange here and orange brown here so on, person face here, these particular neurons in hearing cortex firing which says noise here)," "now these guys firing". Could it even have an address for distal muscle and touch neurons or for retinal neurons? Could the reason brain is always firing be to always have those neurons in memory (ie only ever a short time lapse between neuron firing and the hot zone trying to use the id of them to conjure perception)?<br>
<br>
Do microtubules highlight parts of the journey from thalamus to Vc to create 3d objects?<br>
<br>
Post synaptic potential is like chewing; action potential is like swallowing.<br>
<br>
If you look at yourself you are laying down puzzle pieces that spatially overlap (1) percept of outside world body (and rest of viewed outside would) and (2) percept of internal hidden world body that is shrouded behind the retina in secrecy.<br>
<br>
You can feel the pressure of the fart as it goes out - that level of specificity. Everything you feel the brain is writing.<br>
<br>
Percept Blue and precept red makes precept  purple.<br>
<br>
Could rings of fire be vibrations in ventricles set up by neurons?<br>
<br>
Could vibrational interference patterns be more important than neural patterns for giving rise to perception?<br>
<br>
Astronauts - without gravity vector sensed, do they have head direction vector disorientation? Perhaps, but proprioception of hands and open eyes should reestablish.<br>
<br>
Which one was short duration - the gear turn. So I think the gear turn is the action potential, and the ring of fire is post-synaptic potential!!!!! <br>
<br>
Makes sense time wise too. Ring of fire (post-synaptic potential) first, leading up to a no-turning back ride down the axons via gear turn (action potential)!!!<br>
<br>
If you get high, try to understand color, sound of rain...<br>
<br>
Time is a form of distance and may explain why the 0.1 s past and 0.1s future 3D blocks look smaller than present block.<br>
<br>
Using memories (patterns) to describe it (to describe your inputs/outputs), you create consciousness. This is why in SWS sleep small inputs aren't perceived as they don't make it past thalamus to cortical, patterned, memoried areas. Same with pre-assembled  visual when awake. Or is the consciousness you felt the jerking of muscle movement commands? Like is muscle movement patterns also pattern for creating all reality? But those without cerebellum still are conscious, right? Are those without cortex still conscious (they are said to appear to be but I kinda doubt it)?<br>
<br>
Could hippocampus main function be to guide cortex in formation of new memory patterns? Plus grid cell head direction stuff?<br>
<br>
there seems to be less memory recording @ lower frequency (and higher frequency) rates altho maybe just the memories are written at 7hz high and then only accessed when high again.<br>
<br>
Hello. Perhaps the reason why you can filter through memories by color or by shape. When high is because. That's the same frequency. When you were a baby and you were writing. All these patterns.<br>
<br>
Do the microtubules "read" the rings of fire and interpret each unified (and seeming movie continuous) percept into existence? Does weed slow it down to where you can experience both depending on where you focus? Like whether cube is outward or inward.<br>
<br>
Does something else "read" the rings of fire and generate perception movie therefrom? Such as heart beat and ventricles? Or some etheric machine that we don't know of or some physical thing which we do not yet see or understand the properties thereof (something like how magnetism didn't use to be known about). Does inrush of charge relate to this?<br>
<br>
Movement for climbers YouTube <br>
<br>
Maybe rf->thalamus->cortex is INPUTS CONSCIOUSNESS and rf->bf(basal forebrain)->prefrontal cortex INTERPRETATION CONSCIOUSNESS and layer V cortex -> thalamus ->rf(->cerebellum -> muscles) is OUTPUT CONSCIOUSNESS? Are people with failed cerebellum still aware of the movements they are directing with eyes closed?<br>
Is the theta wave hippocampal loop anything?<br>
<br>
3d cat outline cartoon but realish model and man model with brain overlay or above paw at door <br>
<br>
Retina - L-Glutamate, Acetylcholine, GABA; firing rate 1-1000Hz<br>
<br>
<br>
Should prolly record heart rate and percept rate. Does the increased heart rate cause the seeming slowing of time? Like what is usually 40hz (20-40 per heartbeat) could be 20hz (10-20 per heartbeat) due to thc on retrograde cb1 receptors, and increase in heartbeat to say 160 could put it in 7-14 hz (up to 14-28hz) range??<br>
<br>
Does hemp lessen the power (amplitude, number of neurons firing) of theta/alpha, or does it down-shift the frequency via the damping? It seems it would slow it and add a few more neurons to the path (they get a chance to contribute some neurotransmitters before next action potential). <br>
<br>
Does hemp downshift the f (frequency) of pfc alpha all the way to theta where they interact with hippocampal loop? But I think hippocampal loop gets slowed down too, being also clogged with cb1 receptors. What is the ring of fire? PFC, hippocampal loop, whole neocortex, phasic creation, or some other thing?<br>
<br>
It's like percepts and Geometrical beauty like love lower case are thinner and more ethereal, but therefore more real because more counterspatial.<br>
<br>
Do circadian rhythms and or neurotransmitters only work to knock out power of awake percepts when they're in alpha range? Does weed reduce your awake percept to theta (more relaxed)<br>
<br>
Hatefulness to logic and the beauty in logic is a low, base vibration. Hatefulness to unifiers; Hatefulness to love are nearly the lowest basist vibration, and that is greatly on the rise in society, social media. Fidelity to authoritarian figures/rules-of-strangers ("the mafia") over personal sacrifice in order to love and protect those who are right and in order to protect freedom is a low vibration. Exclusion of others over benevolent inclusion is a low vibration. Uncaring and intentional violence to innocent perceptors including animals is nearly the lowest and most ugly of vibrations. The attempt to murder perfection/love/God and have base vibrations celebrated and enthroned (only apparently) is the very worst thing and may be so slow as to only begin vibration at beginning of all and ends one single vibration at end of all.<br>
<br>
For some, life sucks because they suck (they treat good benevolent people like crap because social pressure or religion tells them to suppress their humanity and morality); for others, life sucks because others suck. Telling people in the latter crowd to cheer up is the opposite of what should be done. Instead, tell the first crowd to de-uglify themselves.<br>
<br>
Weed retrograde is also why you are less accurate, say trying to send an email and first hitting print button then upload button (which tried to save file to iPhone) and finally email button - you temporarily lose the old worn routes that are very accurate and practical but also can be boring and monotonous.<br>
<br>
The electrical activity of neurons always immediately gets interpreted as percepted reality- hence why it is usually so difficult to even perceive the themselves-meaningless firing patterns of neurons (or patterns in dendrites). They have meaning because building memory of which ones fire for various limb movements etc we have constructed a world and an accurate model of a world that most likely does exist!<br>
<br>
Gamma like dude said may not really be oscillatory but rather harmonic noise from lower oscillations. The waves delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma, beta, alpha, theta, delta sound like motorboat starting, accelerating to full throttle, then decelerating to stop. Alpha thru gamma may not really exist. It may be more like neurons on layer 1(/3?) of cortex are not associated (?) with stuff like layer 5 (say motor cortex) and just make lotsa random patterns which respond with a given pattern to a certain stimulus (Event-Related-Potential).<br>
<br>
Pg. 375 of neuroscience - burst mode (?) of flexors then relaxation of stance extensors then burst mode (?) of flexors - was THIS what was generating consciousness??<br>
<br>
Are x,y, z really dimensions? I think not. I think they are just interesting and useful angles. Maybe the whole of space is "1st dimension," psychic activity (all perception) is "2nd dimension" or possibly multi dimensions. Even change of a change could be a higher level dimension sooner than x,y,z.<br>
<br>
If you get really still you can hear your heart beating. Get super slowed via weed and you may be able to sense the weird way you hallucinate all of perceptual existance from gear turn of moving from one 3d pattern of firing (interpreted percept with meaning[or maybe dendrites]) to the next and as it "pulls" you or "jerks" you to the next puzzle piece in time, split second by split second. The pull may be action potentials. If so, the dendrites are coding the 3D blocks of existence and the action potentials are coding the movement therebetween from present to next present and thereby also creating qualia.<br>
<br>
Perceptions are a very inward thing; hence I turned to effects of neurotransmitters to try to make the connection to sensing first hand what the brain is doing.<br>
<br>
Made the connection! Natural law.<br>
Hemp may repress the part of your brain that normally hides the brain's own mechanism of consciousness-creation.<br>
<br>
All the endogenous and exogenous neurotransmitters, descriptions, agonism, power, efficacy, affinity.<br>
<br>
Head direction may be "baked into" the random patterns your brain creates or maybe the ones having to do with head turning.<br>
<br>
Cbd stick prefect way to "de-high" yourself if you get too high.<br>
<br>
The brain usually going so fast you have to throw a gear in the cogs to temporarily slow down or break up its fast movements; thankfully there is a way we can safely do that.<br>
<br>
Our ability as humans to use logic may be due to having complex vocal cords which can emit complex sounds which we can use to link to concepts and ever more abstract notions. Are then parrots intelligent?<br>
<br>
If we collectively became ungovernable like frogs, temporarily letting go of moving around mentally in areas of abstract thought, we could defeat the mafia (they only are powerful by people putting them on pedastal) and be happier.<br>
<br>
E PLURIBUS<br>
Chap 1: Explaining Everything<br>
All you have ever known is the electrical impulses through your brain which actuates or "hallucinates" (causates) your percepted reality. BUT, it's a freaking good model (physicality model/world model) of the parts of the universe your eyes interact with (including the other humans, animals, and simpler forms of agglomerated consciousness like insects and slime molds) AND a good model of your body. So you have your perceptual reality which is a good model of the separate phenomenon of the physically existant universe (with you and others having physical bodies there). Finally, you have the perceptual realities of all other conscious beings (beings that build a model of the world). The perceptual world is created by moving 3d ring-like firings of attention/focus/perception neurons in your brain. The physical universe is probably mostly as we have determined it to be. The differences between you and others is wholly a matter of separate experiences, combined with the "machine learning" you/others applied to create a useful prefrontal filter of ethic or modus operandi rules of operation for any given stimulus. We are all (including animals) almost identical lumps of brain that build models of the world and react to stimuli, perhaps in more or less ethical ways (ethicality bound to the perfect sphere of finest vibration and smoothness), but qualitatively essentially identically. Thus we must show mercy to all (while still defending self from bs) to show mercy to ourselves or to be one with God.<br>
<br>
Lamps feel like burning so maybe dendritic? The dimmer just plain color looks like a very dim Flickr Flickr dendritic Flickr but the differentiation between green and red cheese let me think geez let me think.<br>
<br>
Brain still has to do something to generate black it’s not just the absence of firing because there’s an existential presence of the black there at some location. The blackness of space is different than the blackness of space being observed mentally.<br>
<br>
White headlights feel like (stimulating) input. Blackness doesn’t feel like there’s any input incoming quallia wise.<br>
<br>
Eyes shut there is no observation of the blackness. The quality of black disappears. It’s now become nothingness nothing written nothing drawn out puzzle piece shapes. The you is still drawn but the perceptual inversion point of the lens nothing out past that.<br>
<br>
like why would there be color as this thing that is a universal rule a property of the universe? Doesn’t seem to be an a priori thing to just exist necessarily?<br>
<br>
when you’re listening to thriller, at least as many notes and beats passes as there are in the song there are at least that many brain waves firing the background audio information and probably quite a lot of the focus is going on that as well.<br>
<br>
Could be Apical I mean distal synapses on the dendrites which “don’t do anything anyway could they be being flickered in order to create colors and lamps? lamps perhaps white lamps seem to produce the most burning or flickering. Could black be normal rate of firing and white is faster rates?<br>
<br>
I think I agree that color is one of the last things added I think even movement and object consolidation is all in place before it gets colored and that’s why it’s able to be so smooth (maybe even color is added as an inherent object property) all the time and even when you jerk your eyes around there’s no variance. There’s no of the edge neurons that weren’t firing having all the sudden fire in there being your eyes can race around so freaking fast but there should be stutter there and there’s not.<br>
<br>
dance is actually more romantic to Acro than Acro Van Acro Van Acro van van van van van than acro like better chance of a leading somewhere<br>
<br>
may visual cortex use gamma rays in layer one and prefrontal cortex use layer three and sound if that is gamma wave there or 100 Hz or whatever the hell maybe that’s on layer five or three?<br>
<br>
can you outsmart sickness by simply slowing down when it tries to make your voice wavy slowing down enough to where you maintain control and that prevents that show of force prevents the sickness?<br>
<br>
audio percepts don’t stop when you close your eyes if the music is still going. Seems obvious but think deeply about that! Color and lamps don’t do that they require the eyes open gama firing.<br>
<br>
you definitely have PTSD and that is why there is such inaBility to face the dangers of social presence they don’t even exist but you imagine they exist all the time and you’re convinced they exist all the time! You are at a severe disadvantage because people think you’re trying to be an asshole by not making iContact and engaging in the chance of dialogue with them willingly.<br>
<br>
You do better when being included is already taken care of and you don't have to worry about that. I suspect others do too.<br>
<br>
Got a temporary sense that palms were face up like what if they were they since I didn't knew I percepted they were face up even tho down.<br>
<br>
How is inertia percepted the quality of the sense or feeling of Inertia? That's so much of preception!!!<br>
<br>
You can look at feeling of memories briefly before they deny access. Maybe denying access was a learned habit and can be unlearned.<br>
<br>
It VC casts it in reverse thru the ethereal eyelens to CAST the colors. The VC is like a retina. What's on right goes thru lens to be projected out to left field.<br>
<br>
Vc "retina" can draw stuff color with eyes closed sometimes and it feels like gamma resolution or better, not theta.<br>
<br>
Was the three rings the effect of speedballing? Indica making a circle that lagged due to latency differentiation from normal firing and sativa making a future ring due to firing too fast- rather than circles being because lines clogged by thc retrograde?<br>

More likely they interpret my will to follow religious teaching of checking my sexual desire AS MEANING I'm not interested in them, when nothing could have been further from the truth. So is always checking or second guessing your desires a good thing?  If you're really good at checking your desires because you really want to follow religious teaching, girls interpret it as "this guy is creepy because he's almost happy with 'not being himself.'" They prefer a bold guy even if he is lacking in fidelity to religious teaching. This "physical desire is bad or must always be checked" thing is the obsession or at least largely featured item of many religious circles, and it only ends up punishing the sincere and rewarding the insincere. For that reason it cannot be ethically right; leaving the fact that people MUST be free to do what they really feel is right. Welcome to natural law, which says "do no harm to any sentient being" (except in self defense). That is the ACTUALLY GOOD, CONSISTENT component within every religion, and it cuts out all the nonsense cock blocking (preventing people from getting married or dating that should get married or date) and violence and hypocritical hatefulness.<br>
<br>
The physical universe probably exists as a 2 (or 3D) probably 2D with time providing two legs of dimension one via 3-D movement of the ring and two is by the existence at various points in time thus allowing movement<br>
<br>
you test out world views taking little steps by degrees but sometimes a good video or a good point will resonate that effects tremendous fast change.<br>

<br>
The story of you goes to heaven or Hell only by perpetually existing and being perpetually judged or approved by divine perfection<br>
<br>
your perceptive reality of now lags the universal now by a few hundred milliseconds, but this allows you to create a little into the past and a little into the future and perhaps give a sense of predicting and being correct about a future outcome that you thought you didn’t know what was going to come but you’re actually did because of the time lag<br>
<br>
how many neurons away a neuron is from the percept neurons may have an effect on the level of vibration able to pass on forehand to that neuron in a predictive or micro predictive way<br>
<br>
Could sensitivity percept arise from the fact that there are many inputs more than usual average per unit area like hands and privates and feet and lips?<br>
<br>
Astral protection is just your interest in a differring visual origin perpective point than where your eyes currently are and the interest in that builds up and models begin being made all while visual info is being suppressed to subconscious level.<br>
<br>
Interactions with others are created in real time using prefrontal cortex understanding of self social wise and your own viewing wise. If you know enough you are good, social unfair discriminatory devalueing can be overcome.<br>
<br>
Inclusion is morally upright; exclusion is hate and evil.<br>
<br>
When you're young most of your percepts and motions and feelings are new and you are greatly reinforced by family. When you're older, you refine the habits of neural firing to be EFFICIENT and ACCURATE, but more and more BORING.<br>
<br>
Hemp helps you not fall into possibly horrible old firm habits in your real time social interaction with people. I think weed also suppresses your cerebellum to varying degrees thus resulting in sloppiness with fingers or cleaning pancake dough off hairs of fingers or making mess of more and more coke welling up thru the plastic lid as you clumsily (but seemingly as accurately as ever perceptually) try to poke straw thru perforations in lid meant to be poked thru with straw. <br>
<br>
Even if electrical puzzle pieces of unified now-focus seem simple, I'm sure there's a lot still UNDER THE HOOD that helps create the various qualia, probably utilizing higher frequencies of the 100 hz - 1000Thz range if not higher. Babies take awhile to build models of the world and of more complex things like shorts pockets.<br>
<br>
Animals may be biased relativity wise in seeing their beauty and need to preserve it even at peril to lesser creatures.<br>
<br>
<br>
Its just this perceptual 4D puzzle pieces of what we're attending to like building a super 3D man puzzle like you're usually 2D ring that may morph into 3d squiggle of perception now.  Most of your body and the world doesn't exist in your percept puzzle. Whether your puzzle is alone in existence here is indeterminable from whether there is a separate world puzzle which  we could influence(?) and whether others puzzles exist who our puzzles may interact with by meeting the movements of their world puzzle existence not seeing their thoughts which are a completely different draw out each equally real. The puzzle pieces of you are simpler when your eyes are closed. When eyes open looking at phone, too much complexity in that 
Sleep / eye-closed puzzle-laying of the only reality you know which you percept - is no different qualitatively than alert except heightened focus. Your limbs that move 
Sometimes the importance of that the alert detail (awake) is over-hallucinated. Yes it keeps you alive but alive so you can close eyes and "sleep"(/"meditate")
Color gives heightened awareness like ie heightened focus. You don't determine the puzzle pieces and control it. Preception (reality [you reality]) puzzle pieces getting laid at a rate 2 per heartbeat (or sometimes 16hz) (dun wanna focus second too nerdy focus) roughly. The body and world is an interpretation of the pattern of varying vibration on ring by moving the world and you 3d to result in that 3d puzzle 
And that the ring (OF CREATION) is pulsed may also be <br>
THE RING CAN FLOAT, RATIONAL THOUGHT. (Maybe animals are bound to perception being linked to muscle movement hence their ring can't float and they can't "think" much).<br>
Your body doesn't exist except the part in each 1/4th second (not flowing, puzzle like) that perception focuses on <br>
A puzzle cant know/percept (the pieces), but the adding and frequency of new puzzle pieces the transition is the knowing/perceiving<br>
Flow <br>
The disjunct nature of increasing decreasing 3d puzzle piece existences may induce sharp waves of acceleration (in percept world)<br>
Different vibrations on parts of ring may create color and a listen of speech and body movement foci<br>
Eye open is awareness; eyes closed is you move from that little shell of perceived universe thru the "eyes" percept wise to the "inward" body lying on the bed. Both are creating but one puzzle. Little qualitative distinction IN ULTIMATE REALITY between eyes closed awake vs eyes closed asleep (um, except in SWS aren't there no new puzzle frames added??). Filler: it's possible you never go to sleep(lose consciousness), but rather doze into a state where inputs are mapped in such a weird way as to have no meaning and therefore no storage.
The puzzle is the sense of you <br>
Moving of limbs especially when eyes closed is a major player in the information stored on percept ring <br>
Movements upon (disturbances of) ring are forced that's why it feels perceived. When your body moves it's actually outside forces acting on that ring then you interpret it as you deciding to move your body but the external world had already happened and yes your first brain is part of that that had already happened.
Perception/ is what creates our perception of 3d from 2d!!!!!!! ring moving around <br>
Gamma is more "wake up silly think about real world again."<br>
The waves are your waves of percepting!!! <br>
The waves of the waves. Puzzle piece waves from past waves moving at a new raised power of propagation rate cf to perception(?) THE (3D [4D]) STAIR STEPS Fourier transform are what creates familiarity (remembering is a resonance with a previously created percept ring of focus).<br>
Memory may be hallucinated by measure of easy of creating that percept. AND MAY NOT MATCH IN MEANING.<br>
EXISTENCE MAY BE TOTALLY RANDOM NOISE WHICH IS INTERPRETED AS BODY AND EXISTENCE BUT IT'S REALLY LIKE THERE ONLY EXISTS THIS CIRCLE WHICH IS VIBRATING.<br>
OH IT'S TOTALLY METAPHYSICAL! THAT IS THE YOU PERCEPT PUZZLE! INSIDE THIS PUZZLE AT LEAST (MAYBE NOT OUTSIDE), <br>
<br>
IT STILL INTERACTS WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD EVEN THO IT IS LIFELESS (at least apart from motion it is just puzzle pieces)<br>
How do babies add a new puzzle of existing in the universe? When their brain begins firing. How does brain electricity unify with only one self and not with everyone and every animal nearby? Because there is no match of memory? Would two people listening to binaural beats about 9Hz begin to sync into one? Oh and try binaural beats while high can you see what rate your percepts are via that??
Does computer generate ai? It may in the sense of that if you generate lots of frequencies together it might* makes a meaningful story.<br>
Why is our story predictable then? If noise is random then is the outside world that which is the most same within the noise? Did we divise(or hallucinate) a way to segregate out randomness from order perhaps by lower frequencies being more predictable and higher being less?does this come in discrete increases in number of top portion of sine waves in concentric circles?<br>
<br>
What is second order is vibration of vibration.<br>
Eyes open (focus area) appears smaller and HIGHER FREQUENCY WAVES  -AND COLOR MAY BE A MUCH EVEN FINER VIBRATION WITHIN THAT LARGER FREQUENCY VIBRATION -<br>
<br>
When something feels smooth and real it's because gamma are going strong making that.<br>
<br>
Precept reality is hallucinated from that "sort of ring" of brain neural firing. Maybe hallucinated is too strong - causally created by the edges of 3d larger replacement puzzle blocks which then shrink. You have a little working memory of the before and after blocks. BY THINKING you moved to dating! More and more interpretations of data favorable to that generated until you reach it. Thinking doesn't exist it's just the changing of ideology/pattern of interpretation puzzle block by puzzle block which change in INTERPRETATION being second order hallucinates or casually creates the feeling of thinking.your resisting firing certain pathways is what enables you to create a world model with what things stay the same. It's like that is the quantum in quantum mechanics.<br>
There's you on the world that is physical-puzzle-pieces-one-with-the-world-and-with-all-human-and-animal-puzzles and there's you that is knowing and which intersects with the electrical patterns in brain and doesn't exist except as its own puzzle piece creation but the "knowing" is what it feels like going from you-frame to you-frame.<br>
Brad and ____ and _____ etc. exist as a story <br>
It's because there's consistency that a world is generated <br>
Move to where you want in your mind <br>
The world is the impressions made on a circle. Maybe like super strings? But percept strings. The story of you exists because it could explain third level vibrations on this ring. Waving of Waving of Waving. Think of dimensions not as x,y,z but as levels deep in the ring-vibration which infinite regressions represents yet a whole nother octave up of 
Remember our guessed percepts are usually accurate(consistent with made model of truck or something) in modeling world or external stimuli on ring. Dunno if random or I guess real world making impressions on ring (namely firing "ring" of neurons) (SO I GUESS WE'RE 3D after all!) or its just random noise (ie 2d ring) most successfully interpreted as a world. There's no need for putting all 
When the electrons move the puzzle piece gets to start expanding anew.<br>
Lots of stimuli sensors to the outside world. And remember it's a PERCEPT puzzle piece!<br>
THERE CAN STILL BE A GOD AND HEAVEN EVEN IF THERE'S NOT ONE IN YOUR PUZZLE CREATION. A GOD AND HEAVEN PUZZLE KIT. That's not demeaning to deity because you never demean the realness of your personal percept-existance puzzle even tho it is a puzzle.<br>
I bet gamma waves and others are just same as high and why time slows down because your higher frequncy (which may be around a ring [color may be phasic via sine geometry?] SPINNING) you're creating more puzzle pieces per unit time making preceptions smoother and less roughed edges!!!<br>
You can create any reality you want inside there altho contingent on good interaction with outside world to stay existent. What creates concept of a being in the world (a "you") is the sensor organs giving power of decision to quantum resolution before going to muscles or brain neurons that influence and change the world. Maybe you is vibrations of DNA inside cell body of neuron somehow affecting the patterns of signaling to go downstream and whether to fire action potential.<br>
<br>
The brain creates the you puzzle mostly by a line or ring of firing which certain patterns mean something (mostly the edges of your limbs) or have past to present vibrations helping to resolve to a memory. The blank slate of the brain makes order from it's input (mostly correctly) in creation of you+"perceived-world" puzzle. Or more like that ring of fire change in position/neuron-team-membership-consisting-of-whom changing in steps (3d becoming 4d by adding layers to onion puzzle) CREATES the perception of a being being at the helm of impacting changes hitting him and the chosen interpretation and response thereto. It's real while being a second order transient thing.<br>
Dunt need every frequency of sound faithfully reproduced. Just the edge of the feeling. That's why all percept can be "generated" from the same little region of brain (cortex shell) and why it even feels like a ring of fire with shallow depth because cortex is THIN. Maybe the intersection angle of brain waves with neurons outwards radially creates weird angle stuff with tissue of cortex resulting in 3d world hallucination. Maybe each puzzle piece is a firing of each say delta or maybe rather alpha and or theta brain wave (prolly alpha ie lsd effect) and is first small in prefrontal cortex and traces puzzle piece bigger biggest at half way then scales down again to occipital lobe <br>
But affected always results in then effecting ie transmitting the perturbation. Our sense of choice arises from seeing the changes b/w that sensed(encountered;changed) and that effected outward on world. Yous are detailed condensed bits on the fractal.<br>
Can everything (YOU-PERCEPTUAL) arise from random 1d noise? Quite possibly. But can both YOU and orderly world with orderly YOU-ordered/arranged  objects and OTHER-PERCEPT-PUZZLES |AND| the predictable interactions therebetween which show a real world and universe with real physical people and animals? THAT REQUIRES EXTRA DIMENSION-LAYERS almost a SPECIFIC SUPER-COMPLEX WAVE of WAVE OF WAVE like the level of specificity <br>
Usually you don't feel the individual pieces of puzzle because the smoothness seduces or rather hypnotizes you but no qualitative mechanistic difference between "writing" pain or sound or visual attention or even color. When you can feel the individual puzzle pieces why is it always at but one frequency at any given exact thinnest slice of time? Or maybe it is spread a bit with overlay of frequencies very near above and below it. But if delta thru gamma have all kinds of frequencies going on why only one to make the puzzle pieces ie to make the ring of fire? Maybe one frequency is reserved for the ring of fire (maybe that is 40hz gamma!) and other frequencies handle sub-conscious things? But it seems all frequencies would be adding to consciousness and perhaps some to color some to sound. Maybe I only felt to level of slowing down to sense individual puzzle pieces of alpha range or rather frequency but beta and gamma and delta are making different time chunks of puzzle piece size and therefore possible level of detail. Maybe 40hz+/- handles colors. Well what wave goes down when you close your eyes may carry all the qualitatively different aspects of visual percepts like color place environment distance darkness to lightness head direction etc. Maybe check relation of GPS accelerometer to brain waves to see if head direction seems to be linked to ie carried on a certain bandwidth since it is so underratingly central to our precept.<br>
Does the skull hold in the waves? Cause there seems so much importance of memory. It may be synaptically or neurally-interior adapted. An ease of firing a low bar needed to fire.<br>
I perceived my own individual alpha waves while high tonight!!! I made the connection!!! Conscious (I've tasted) of how consciousness is created!! Where the neurons fire is your 3d model of the universe but only of that momentary percept attention area construct -- parts of which seem to indicate motion of outside of limb and parts seem to indicate higher level imported stuff like words on phone of created outside perceived visual or mentally  created world. I bet the visual world is carried on higher frequency waves than building blocks perhaps at 40hz.<br>
I wonder if any waves go sagittal or transverse or whatever to help represent head direction. I think combined consciousness is the complex wave of all these freqiencies combined with all these neutral patterns and stored memories.<br>
I wonder that if weed is increasing my alpha or (prolly) gamma waves that there is some drug which would enable you to focus on whatever frequency gives rise to visual phenom and color. Maybe there is some fundamental minimum wave say maybe the rate of heartbeat which first seven "notes" or 1/heartbeat, 2/heartbeat, 3/heartbeat, 4/heartbeat, 5/heartbeat, 6/heartbeat, 7/heartbeat give rise to a geometrical sense of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, magenta and maybe this planck-size frequency of about 2 hz is the fundamentally numerically least number of waves in a percept unit Planck-percept-distance.<br>
Maybe percept is the change in deviation from normal wave noise. Maybe the normal noise CREATED BY BRAIN INTENTIONALLY AS THE BACKDROP OF NORMAL STATE is not conscious but the moment by moment deviation change feels like consciousness. Maybe normal states and really just MENTALLY HIGHLIGHTED parts of the percept of your body and fingers holding phone are encoded in the backdrop normal noise and deviations show the changes to your perceived world.<br>
At each heartbeat start perhaps that is where all brain activity goes to zero together if the brain is the coordinated in all frequencies via the heartbeat.<br>
I wonder if weed produces more you puzzle pieces hitting against the PHYSICAL puzzle pieces of earth and you and others and stars PER UNIT TIME meaning time (experience of universe) does intensify or ie slow down because you have to slow world "down" to fit it all in.<br>
<br>
Electrons accelerating in a way that can hallucinate or cause a meaningful percept will, and perhaps they have to be joined via heartbeat like lotus petals of all frequency  sizes joining via stem. Like all going to zero every half second. Like Cia said Buddha (ALL-KNOWING) universe created or returned to once for a split moment twice a second.<br>
<br>
The patterns of brain neural hook up allowed in group members firing over time THE PATTERNS OF WHO'S ALLOWED IN EACH GIVEN MOMENT THEN COLLECTED OVER TIME the brain learns it's model of the world and somehow teaches memories of certain things and of learned things.<br>
<br>
Birth and death are the divergence and convergence points to the physical puzzle. Can you carry on with being (existing) at 0hz or does that merge you with the Buddha universe?<br>
<br>
How your brain makes it feel like some things are bad or painful is hard to understand but prolly some frequency that it somehow trains to be associated with loss. Maybe importance (gamma) plus pain (some other frequency or unpleasant 3d dissonance pattern).<br>
<br>
Brain just needs a useful ie representative way to order firing rates and patterns that is consistent with reality to create hallucinations or actuation percepts, however varying degree of real you consider them philosophically.<br>
<br>
It would be cool to record all brain wave frequencies in all 3d areas at varius times and then look at movement of each ring of frequency and see what corresponds to ring of fire creating perceptual-you-existence vibrating "loop".<br>
<br>
People that are in tune may be so because similar heart rate or favored base brain wave. Dissonance may result from some combo of two people's frequencies. We impress more by our words(/concepts) than by our motions(/"actions").<br>
<br>
Non intellect often have more social skill because they give no space to intelligence so whole brain gets good at social.<br>
<br>
Maybe the impouring na2+ or whatever is making waves on the scaffolding of the microtubules and making interference patterns on those guys and the little hexes leading to much finer vibrations. Maybe the actual correlate of consciousness is the uber high like 700 THz thingy that gets suppressed with anesthesia. Maybe length/spacing-placement of myelin sheath contribute to what some higher frequencies are put out.<br>
<br>
Sometimes people don't mesh because they lack the common great childhood experiences you had. <br>
<br>
Weed gives you a second chance on identifying everything (even read hurt or disappointment) because it dampens everything (cb1 retrograde) but therefore also the immediate patterned behavior. This also slows the patterned locking of mind wandering matching with memories. You can remember memories from the original creation rather than the immediately and always programmed correlation. These crappy correlations-to-trivializations-of-memory get worse over time and weed brings back the original full-color memory as it were.<br>
<br>
I am what they did to me - cause and effect - but they are what the world did to them and so back. Or is there such a thing as withstanding influences of bad? Meeting hate and hurt with love and giving? There must be and that is those ducks. And that is Christ hence why his resonant power via sacrificial love for hate. Was the first uncaused cause good such as God or bad such as original sin? That the one bad act poisoned the entirety of remaining worldness (humanity/animal-hood)? But not entirely in that not everything humanity does is bad or unbeautiful but rather much is good. Perspectives can see more good or more evil.<br>
<br>
The prefrontal cortex asks, "is the created percept consistent with continued incoming data?" Hence why it dishes out level of certitude with all various things. Level of certitude may have specific frequency range correlate.<br>
<br>
Perceiving = matching the what-was-thought-to-have-occurred-in-model and continued real world data. The prediction may be spelled in pre-priming pumps of which dendrites/basal/apical connections/neuron prior to firing and firing indicates pleased with prediction given new incoming data. Maybe why everything (all percept) has a bit of deja-vu feel to it.<br>
<br>
Some rings of fire are root like mesh of layer 1 and some are radially up/down parallel/somewhat perpendicular... Wonder if this has anything to correlate with how qualitative percepts are created. Like the electrons carving it out are vectors with direction and perhaps amplitude which may have huge significance in storing info or explaining how adding time gives rise to our particular entire consciousness.<br>
<br>
What if the (you existance and natural law ethics) are higher and higher finer vibrations which are increasingly REAL due to being a wallcloud of a wallcloud- a perturbation of a perturbation. The higher the order the realer it is tho the further it is in a way from physicality. Or higher dimensionality in terms of wave of wave of wave like a fractal getting more detail the closer to the edge you go.<br>
<br>
What if all the universe is the complexity of that fractal and God is at the upper limit ie infinitely connected with the thinnest slice of edge.<br>
<br>
But the resilience is because it was learned as an ethic. <br>
<br>
Why divine love sometimes seems unworthy goal is BECAUSE it is so thin a slice - it resides in the smallest pinpoint with all the complexity and existance of the most real. LOVE is the most real, in the face of anything. Love cobalanced with reasonable kind careful precise-like-a-caring-military-strike-to-knock-out-evil (just presuppose that exists somewhere for a moment -it doesn't always exist like that I know) generous SELF-DEFENSE: NATURAL LAW.<br>
<br>
Could the convolutions on cortex be doing the 90° etc transforms for all objects in space and for representation of self body and head direction?<br>
<br>
Insular cortex is 180° reversed from cingulate cortex. Sound is 90° perpendicular (to both) but tilted a little with rear posterior uplifted superiorly relative to horizontal.<br>
Thumb-out for left insular; thumb-down (plumb hanging Bob pulled posterior) left hearing; thumb-in for left cingulate cortex. CINGULATE CORTEX (AND/OR INSULAR CORTEX) GIVES RISE TO HEAD DIRECTION PERCEPT!! Do these plus shell of cortex coordinate so as to produce certain shape or patterns into cerebrospinal fluid which then generates percepts? IS HEARTBEAT going thru cerebrospinal fluid via integrating with amplified brain electron wave expansion shells the grand unifier and giver of consciousness? Does distance from layers of cerebral cortex to skull intentional so as to AMPLIFY STANDING WAVES of particular frequencies in the cerebrospinal fluid just like ear hammers amplify sound signals in liquid of cochlea? And like cell phone signals are made standing waves and thus amplified in those hollow copper spheres in cell tower antennae? And does the 3d shape of ventricles interact by design with shapes of waves generated in varius parts of brain (insular, cingulate, shell)?<br>
<br>
Yea different element ions Na2+, P+, might be different cursors tracing perceptual existance but the neuron is a good agglomerating cursor - a radially-inward rush of Na followed by immediate outrush of P creates the prefect shearing force of shearing off a wave. The outer peninsular and inner inlet regions of cortex by firing same time can create two slightly flam-like waves which may be useful plus the angles. The convoluted shell surface of cortex may be perfect for illustrating all kinds of 3d properties and relativity-between-objects-or-self TRANSFORMS!!<br>
<br>
A charge seems to have content creation. Neutral matter almost seems like a standing wave or one where charge and anti charge (proton and electron or there subatomic unit quarks) cock-block creation.<br>
<br>
Is electron source or sink? Na/P could be sink giving rise to choice or sense of will or providing to universe- I-style waves; Ca at dendrite synapses could be perception of things acting on you preception style waves- the perceived style waves. Space/counterspace pulse sent along a line but the combined lines integrated along whole path of brain wave is the movement over time of ring of fire percept ring. Maybe the 50hz electrical of the heart is where real perception is created by crashing waves coming thru cerebrospinal fluid cavity and that complex info getting embedded on 50hz oscillations. Or something in fluid or near substantial nigra vibrating at extremely high rate unifying and creating consciousness. The anesthesia thing may be knocking out one needed step for consciousness without knocking out the final top-level mechanism that creates consciousness!<br>
<br>
The perception of you and your view of world is created by ring of fire of cortex attention firing at any given point to very few specific visual (especially foveal), sound, color, feeling stimuli. It's fairly easy to do. This is the neural firing of a real physical brain in a physical world relating with physical objects and physical people who also have percept puzzle creations themselves. We've been looking at color and space and meaning behind beautiful music too dividedly- there is but one whole precept ring of fire which change between two rings of fire in time and place (and maybe second or third or more order(s)) which change or second or third or together layers give rise to that complex percept puzzle piece at any given time. The change between rings creates the feeling of whatever is needed that explains data - color is not different from any other in that all are alike generated by difference between the newly-being-added onion ring layers of (3d to 4d via time) puzzle pieces.<br>
<br>
We are self-teaching from experience of what to put in place for our ethic. In that sense we have free will but that obviously is just a second order ripple still caused from outside influence. Is spirituality the real free will which is brought into existence via getting right with oneself(/"God")?<br>
<br>
Or do ventricles produce head direction sense?<br>
<br>
How do electrons/protons arise from quarks or matter antimatter pairs how to they change from one to other? This should explain the universe. Maybe not gravity. May be a slight difference in - vs + of phase or speed of source vs drain. A greater (or higher frequency) drain relative to source wouldn't create gravity if + and + repel. It would explain two sinks repelling and two sources repelling like with static charges and balloons. How would it explain light and such?<br>
<br>
Would two people touching a tesla coil tend to unify them? You seem to perceive the shock of electrostatic as identical in a sense to that percept ring of fire.<br>
<br>
Pain is "OK" in that the highest vibration LOVE always says it is wrong and since the highest vibration says it is wrong, just that enables it's endurance altho not fun yet never approved of by the highest vibration which is all that matters in terms of right and wrong.<br>
<br>
Love is a perfect circle or mobius or eternity wrap because highest number of sides (infinity) creates first triangle then square then Pentagon... then circle. It is an ideal which can never be met; as asymptotic lines never meet; but which one strives to attain unto. It is the prefect harmony of right treatment of others and endurance of some sacrifice combined with proper balance but not too much of defense of self but you do want lots of self defense against esp stupid or harmful or foul intrusions. Love may be concentric perfect spheres or whatever shape goes for each of concentrically adding layers of dimensionality- the infinite within the finite!<br>
<br>
We may benevolent as a species due to roundness of head most shaping finer geometric patterns.<br>
<br>
So percepts may be generated by brain waves across brain so that one block of cohered percept is 0.2 seconds or 0.1 seconds but starts at back or front and goes opposite way and like the crt's created a movie with a moving "electron cursor writing on a sulfer (?) screen," so our brain generates the perception of us+our interaction with universe with this moving flash kinda like the flash going across the copier screen when making a copy. At each point complexity in vibration frequencies leads to ring of fire seeming to have qualities which may be real in a second order way.<br>
<br>
I NEED TO SEE MOVIE OF BRAIN WAVES! AT EACH FREQUENCY WATCH THE MOVEMENTS.<br>
<br>
A magnet is a HURRICANE OR GALAXY of source (and probably not a hurricane of drain).  That is it creates a patterned, "spun up" source while drain remains stationary. But it doesnt repel other sources as entities (because magnet has no net charge) nor repel their effluent ("light" "exuding ether stuff") but rather creates strong "MAGNETIC" effects that make two magnets want to get in line and the net outer spinning layer may shrink or however you want to think of creation of magnetism prolly the best way is as second order ie ELECTRIC ACCELERATION effect.<br>
<br>
Why then does a magnet have a repelling diamagnetic effect on most elements? Why does a CHANGING magnetic field (ie a CHANGE in the CHANGING wobble of Hurricane) be resisted by whatever develops in copper when "currents" can flow? Cause copper/alum has free electrons and iron has free domains (improbable)?<br>
<br>
Why does gravity have an attracting force between all matter charged or non-charged? Maybe has to do with constant speed of light?<br>
<br>
Maybe Michaelson Morley can be explained as another double slit experiment where the light could go at any speed but an observer collapses it to just his reference point?<br>
<br>
Maybe the neuronal correlate of consciousness frequency itself oscillates up and down somewhat but more down for sleeping. What regulates what frequency shall be the correlate at any moment?<br>
<br>
Does the skull not only help bind together all of"you" electric pulses BUT ALSO keep out the brain music of foreign entities to ensure your own survival by paying attention to yourself?<br>
<br>
The reason it has been hard to see the mechanism of consciousness is because it erases itself via its divine smoothness. VERY EFFECTIVE IN TRICKING ME AND EVERYONE!<br>
<br>
It is possible for God and Good to both exist and not exist. It is a thin line the thinnest ever on which God and Good reside, but I think thinner (finer, more circle-like vibrations) is realer and truer. There must be Good if there is any good or meaning. Infinity within finite provides the meaning!<br>
<br>
Others loving you feels more stable than you loving yourself but intellectuals sometimes must do the latter as much as they crave support.<br>
<br>
The architecture of the insular and cingulate corteces and/or of the ventricles could give isotopic mechanistic creation of sense of head direction.<br>
<br>
The skull and vibrational cavity and fluid of vetricles may act as "the binding agent" or as a lower level correlate among more than one of consciousness.<br>
<br>
As of Jan 1, 2022, I understand the basic mechanism/correlate giving rise to consciousness. This consciousness includes sense of self, sense of right/wrong, perception of world when eyes or ears open, proprioception of body and where it lays, head direction, eye direction, point of focus if not what fovea is on (rare and a rarefied percept not as potent as simply moving fovea to the point of interest), resonates somehow with memories. Very Short term memory (about 0.5 seconds before and after) built into the waves of perception themselves, 3d of percept is created by 2d ring of focus plus moving it around over time in a 3d sort of way around cerebral cortex perhaps by will in the cell bodies of the neurons (more likely will is hallucinated as happening altho quantum may give actual power of will to cell bodies but that will is prolly prelearned ethics/patterns of responses to stimuli), plus short term and long term memory. I don't quite understand color but it appears to be a high frequency phenomenon within a section on the ring of interest. I think the physical brain and world is real 3d w/ x, y, z.<br>
<br>
Will can exist as that fine line of exquisite detail - a sort of probable limbo.<br>
<br>
Bad has to exist for it to be actually bad but it is forever condemned by the Evergood right. That is, looking for a way to be able to live after seeing evil done to one, the pain and ugly can be assuaged by knowing the Good condemns it and no one can come to the Good without first relinquishing the bad. <br>
<br>
Jesus and the Gospels are very geometrical. Some other religions have geometry too. Of course Buddhism has geometry galore.<br>
<br>
Movement is done by cycling thru memories (ie well worn patterns). Sleep improves the motion and cerebellum adds too to fine tuning. Thinking is also a cycling thru rings of fire (more or less worn paths of memory). You can filter memory by color, by shape, (by mood(?)). Pictorial examples of each. Green grass changing to slightly off green water to blah; angle changing this memory that chair that high chair etc.<br>
<br>
It's almost like going from one unified percept puzzle piece to the NEXT FUTURE one or coming from the NEXT PAST one or both more like in the now the past one first going to present then the present going to future one each TURNS A GEAR like the clicks going thru a subway or amusement park turny gate that you press down with your hand or stomach and the angling of bars spinning allows you thru. The TURNING OF THE GEAR is consciousness and includes color, limb outline (wherever attention on limbs is CURRENTLY focused in saccade-like movements THE BRAIN GOES FROM THOUGHT TO THOUGHT AND 2D trace to 2D trace just like saccadic eye movements but able to turn in 3 directions the plane of circle better), sound highlight, emotion highlight, if eyes open them also visual cone and a bit of model of world which crunches up in a relatively small amount of the ring of fire but quite detailed.<br>

It may be that universal time does not exist (and neither perceptual time as percept is a creation of matter) but rather the whole universe over all time is actually 5D geometry. Or 4D. Or 2D with two or three waves upon waves upon waves thing. Or perhaps 1D random or purposeful noise or even some weird 1D geometry with waves of waves of waves of waves or perhaps an infinity of waves with God in the infinity.<br>

Could weed increase shutter speed (shorter exposure) of percept building block and hence the motion become choppy enough to notice the creation of each piece.<br>
<br>
The disconnection between your muscular movements when high may be the memory muscular movement is trying to go at its same old frequency while you are trying to be at a faster or slower frequency I don’t know which<br>

<br>
The chops between neurol Ring of fire burning is a layer of synapse. Weed is a retrograde messenger - dials back the incoming signals' effect at end of axon sending signal across to dendrite of downstream neuron - which results in the next neuron firing at a slightly later time than usual and results in the disjunctions between percept puzzle pieces REVEALING THE USUALLY HIDDEN creating of percept.<br>
<br>
to create AI do you need to provide it with inputs that it can move around to create a model and it needs to have a baseline activity to start it out and there may have to be some kind of quantum connection between perception and choosing how to act and perhaps hallucination of desires or goals or rewards or rewards and pain or loss at lacking and the ability to develop some sort of moral filter.<br>
<br>
could it also be that weed so suppresses retrograde style that neurons that may have been out of phase and help to smooth transitions between puzzle pieces now acting in an all or nothing fashion and possibly even only fire half the time or a quarter of the times that they normally would because they have been so suppressed by weed? Could the prefrontal cortex also be panicking due to this and is why it enlists all its neurons to fire en mass and wants to make sure the message gets through?<br>
<br>
eyes open perception may actually be less useful to understanding the creation of percepts than eyes closed perception<br>
<br>
The Parkinson’s like jerky movement in walking and moving arms when you get extremely high they also be not only nation of cerebellar cortex they could also be halving or quartering the firing rate of the pyramidal neurons in the motor cortex layer five which project eventually to the muscles.<br>
<br>
The ring of fire never seems to pick up and move over a long way all of a sudden.it always seems to stay connected to its previous and future positions and move by increments<br>
<br>
I wonder if population centers have grown old too and has to weed out all the unique and artful restaurants and every freaking town just has Cracker Barrel and Chick-fil-A at Subway and Burger King and Taco Bell. It’s really a sad depressing state of affairs. Even if it’s efficient there’s need for a little bit of art and interest.<br>
<br>
could weed be lowering the gamma waves (correlates of consciousness?) all the way from 40 Hz down to theta level four or 5 Hz? Seems like quite a stretch but possibly.<br>
<br>
My sense of time was so messed up while high that I had to use my pulse and I counted two brain wave percept puzzle pieces created per pulse. I later measured my pulse and found that it was about 2 hz itself so that’s why I think the correlates of consciousness while high back to regular time range from 4 Hz up to about 13 Hz and yes it did seem like it was variable.<br>

Roughly how many neurons are coming for one pixel on the eye? Isn’t it about one maybe 10 maybe 100 at the very best? so that one or so neuron must be sufficient with however many times it’s axons branch off at the tip to fire the next neuron starting at the lateral geniculate nucleus and so on at the pyramidal neuron at V1.<br>

could the perceptual visual sphere be at about 24 Hz refresh rate? With retina and v1 original subconscious being prolly higher like 100hz?<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>







I think with brain, "all frequencies" are going, within limits. Perhaps so with the physical world, all frequencies of "refresh rate" are going on at same time perhaps with meeting and greeting and checking in with parole officer once a second or once every 1/300 millionths of a second. Maybe this has to do with gravity and/or why light's speed appears constant to every observer despite added motion. Objects can be in motion and at rest at same time. If so, universe's zero pulse rate where all nodes meet may also provide a sort of Planck's max duration of time before returning to ether but perhaps that is the whole time of the whole universe and only happens at beginning and end.<br>

Ergot (correction - argyreia nervosa seeds) (NOTE: Fully legal, but can be dangerous). Not pleasant. Within 5 or 10 minutes I felt a change in brain waves/head space. Relaxes analytical brainwaves I suppose and heightens emotive waves, but not like weed does. Also, the paranoia of Ergot is different from the sativa weed stains which induce paranoia; the off-and-on paranoia of Ergot is like an emotionally worried dog that is afraid everything isn't okay even tho it is, and just could benefit by being told "everything's okay boy!" It's not a worry like paranoia; it's a worry that something frightening might happen and you might royally fuck things up due to your extra emotion. No hallucinations at half a seed dose. I listened to music just so I wouldn't perchance take myself to some dark or bad mental place, which I feared I may have otherwise. The beginning of each song impressed a little more than usual but quickly got boring. Even George Michael's Careless Whisper got boring, whereas with blue lotus it was insanely interesting the whole way thru and so relaxing. Well maybe argyreia nervosa seeds aren't ergot but rather ergine-LSA (d-lysergic acid amide), which altho like lsd, fails to produce any of the lsd type effects. In any event it was not beneficial in any way imo. It is a vasoconstrictor so has been used to stop bleeding after childbirth.<br>

You can demystify timbre by decomposing sound to three or more components that create it and you can hear the individual components in isolation and see how they meld into one sound with timbre. It almost explains the soundness of sound but dunno. Color seems to be added to grayscale.<br>

When do after a couple hours in a rock climbing gym then went to get food at a Jerusalem Grill then when we got back to the gym since it was cold outside short pants and short sleeves and I was worn out and well fed and just wanted to go to sleep in the warm to the car hardly think of getting out in the cold just to get to the gym. Then a little puff of St. John a little puff of St. John and 10 seconds later the cold is not even an issue whatsoever and I actually feel like I want to go climbing and when I get in the gym I start knocking out some 5.11s definitely horses or routes above what grade I would’ve done. it’s like layer five of the neo cortex must be involved in stamina. And it’s funny how your brain runs your body no more than 50% dead like your phone battery does because give it some St. John and wow you find out that you had the strength there all along but apparently your brain was just not going to use that. I don’t know if it’s 50% or what the level is but that’s pretty freaking amazing. So even mental stamina as well as the willingness or apparent willingness of muscles to cooperate is a hallucination and just a brain created thing. if your hand slips off the hold without St. John’s but is able to cling on with the St. John’s then apparently it wasn’t a problem with the muscle in the first place the muscle could’ve held on either way but the brain was why would not send a signal to hold on. so apparently the brain down regulates actual ability of muscle in order to maybe save it for emergencies? also I have hurt St. John’s while climbing with folks that were not very welcoming and while it did boost my stamina did nothing whatsoever to endear me to the people that were not including me. Whereas sativa weed would have probably overcome the social obstacle while not necessarily helping with the physical obstacle.<br>

41,253 square degrees can be represented by 3 sets of 180 neurons, each for x-y, y-z, and z-x axes (1080 neurons total). Note that humans only have about 18% of this in visual view at any given time, so seems preponderance of need is in positive x-y plane with a little on y-z and 360° but only components not pure in z-x axis. The three canals prolly have to do with head direction vector and rotation and acceleration of that vector.<br>

In short, timbre explained by overtones (complex accelerations of matter?), magnetism explained by accelerations of charge; what will explain consciousness and matter and gravity?<br>
<br>
The things which hold mystery may often be resolved; so doing may be both thrilling and sad (or even anti-climatic) at the same time - the mystery is gone, but the intrigue is too. Nevertheless, to know something is an absolutely worthy goal, and it is the only path to progression and invention.<br>
<br>
I have (or rather, someone else has) solved some of my life mysteries while others remain elusive. But the fact that some things (which held such intrigue as to defy ever being known) have been understood makes me all the more want to find an answer to everything:<br>
<br>
sound timbre was the first thing I found an answer to; <br>
<br>
magnetism, while I didn't find an answer that goes all the way down to the fundamental mechanisms giving rise to matter, still is extremely satisfying as being quite possibly correct or at least the geometry being self-consistent;<br>
<br>
matter, gravity, space, time, and charge, are not known on a fundamental mechanism level but I hope they will be;<br>
<br>
consciousness, that is percepts and the entity (or seeming entity) doing the percepting, is not understood and screams for investigation.<br>
<br>
Whether matter or consciousness is more central to the nature of reality I don't know. Being an open-minded person, until I find a copacetic model, I remain open to both- that neurons really do somehow generate "you" and your perception of color and space and emotions; AND that consiousness may be much more central with matter a rather poor thing compared to the vistas of experience opened up by the percept realm, which realm may even have a role in the existence of "the universe."<br>

Timbre<br>

How can a flute and an oboe playing the same note at the same volume (or a person singing an "a" or "e" vowel) all sound so different, if the only thing air is carrying is frequency and amplitude? The Physics of Speech by Daniel Fry finally and beautifully answered this question. <br>
<br>
Magnetism<br>
<br>
The mysterious powers displayed by magnets fascinated me for years until a I encountered a video that proposed that it could all be explained by the acceleration of a charge. Normally a charge radiates out repulsion (of like charges) at the speed of light; but acceleration of the charge causes a kink to radiate outwards; said kink, upon arriving at another charge, exerts a secondary electric force on the charge at somewhat of an angle relative to the primary charge repulsion which is outward from the accelerating charge. Hence magnetism, and the whole EM spectrum, is nothing but a kink in electric repulsion radiated outward at the speed of light. A cylindrical magnet with north and south faces on flat planes has all electron spins canceled except outside layer of atoms on magnet; this outer layer's electrons is similar to an ever-continuing wire of DC electricity (without much if any resistance or heat, and not perfect as each electron spends half its time going in the "wire" and the other half going the other way (but canceled out by inner layer atom's electron). Since positive and negative charges (protons and electrons) are balanced, static electricity (build up of positive or negative charge) has no apparent effects on the magnet (no primary electric effects observed); but when it comes to secondary effects, the magnet is a powerhouse! Since the electrons on the outside may be looked at as a single group of electrons orbiting the magnet at super high speeds, there is plenty of electron acceleration going on (acceleration by definition includes directional change since it gives rise to a kink), and hence TONS of the kink. When two such disc magnets get together, the north attracts the south not because there is some north or south property of magnets, but because that is the orientation that their electrons will both be going clockwise (or counterclockwise, depending on whether you're looking from top or bottom). Thus, the kink that is spreading outwards now increases in magnitude, and the magnets have reduced the fighting between each other to the least possible. <br>
<br>
But all this falls apart if we accept quantum mechanics telling us that the electrons don't spin around the nucleus but rather are more like static, appearing at various points. There could still be some mechanism giving rise to the spin, such as electrons or protons having a counterspatial (point-like; taking up zero space; location mapped but unimportant) inertial spin that can be lined up in the same direction in the creation of a magnet. In any event, we don't know the fundamental mechanism that explains matter, and the model of some sort of spin or angular momentum being involved and giving rise to what we thought was a separate phenomenon of magnetism is quite copacetic, as it can satisfy nearly all the mysterious behaviors of magnets, including its interactions with copper (eddy currents, generation/use of electricity via dynamo/motor), the ways two or more magnets come together (on top arrangement, side-by-side arrangement, tiny magnet on top or side of large magnet), the ways iron nails or washers interact (at close range and when released to actually touch the magnet); perhaps the only thing that I haven't fleshed out is how it would explain diamagnetism (why nearly all matter is ever-so-slighty repelled in the presence of a strong magnetic field) (maybe that is because normal matter can't cooperate on getting it's atoms in-sync with the incoming perpetual kink and hence experiences a little of the repellant force of kinks out-of-whack, but it would seem matter would be neutral in having an average of orientations of its atoms such that neither attraction or repulsion would be occurring).<br>
<br>
Einstein, while a man I highly look up to (wasn't he vegetarian, anti-bigotry-fueled-war, and of course smart?), has theories (general and special relativity) which could be true but I don't find them particularly attractive because they seem self-inconsistent. It's hard to nail down exactly how (because they always seem to have an answer that you hadn't thought of), and it's a very intriguing theory of reality, but it hasn't helped us understand the fundamental level mechanisms giving rise to existence to-date.<br>

Consciousness <br>
<br>
Rings of Fire: How the Brain Makes Consciousness <br>
Bank, geometrical (cube plus sphere plus accessories), up stays anti-gravity or head-crown up <br>
Movements, 10-200 Hz?<br>
Ebb & Flow, 0.25 Hz<br>
Shift of Attitude of Bank, hours-1?<br>
Ring trace, within cycle of consciousness, maybe 1/3 of its duration <br>
Rings 2-10Hz (probably hippocampal theta)<br>
Could bank be layer 5 of cortex and meaning of rings be provided in real time by layers 2,3?<br>
Something fleshes rings out to full 3d surfaces (body + world) and prolly when sober it does an exquisite job of fleshing it out, even if it is largely background (not paid focal attention to) (the background provides the ability to know where to look for further info and you can focus without looking and know color).<br>
3D shapes are prolly just a very well fleshed out set of surfaces (sulfur rock, cone, large retina).<br>
Why does there form a box around each 3D shape? What does this? Same rate as rings/shapes, right?<br>
At times the jello boxes appear to be being laid down like cored pineapple slices from above in corkscrew manner (2 Hz always, right?). What does this?<br>
<br>
Hipp&buds at hyper like to lay at 2 Hz - somewhere there could be corkscrew - icing on cake, altho still just parts of it stand out like the conic text, so not like all of that goes to memory, or at least not all stands out loudly within memory (maybe that story gets fully written). Maybe subpopulation of cells with hcn1 that happens to 2 hertzify makes the corkscrew and hence the story which feeds into memory. Whilst the predominating theta rhythm creates rings, which cortex fills out and contextualizes. And the hippocampus is handling both slow gamma (25-60 Hz [25-55 Hz]) and fast gamma (60-100 Hz), one of which could definitely be 3d video feed from cortex (its gamma ranging from 30-140 Hz).<br>
<br>
Where is bank stored? <br>
<br>
Prosubiculum goes to pfc (via AM [anteromedial thalamic nuclei]); presubiculum goes to parietal cortex (via AV [anteroventral thalamic nuclei])!<br>

That's cool that "everything" is encoded on the rings, but what about the visual backdrop? How exactly is that done?<br>

Two critical paths for wakefulness vs sleep (can kill one or other and it degrades sleep a decent bit but both causes coma)- <br>
1. Preceruleus->Medial Septum->Hipp<br>
2. Parabrachial nuclei->Basal Forebrain->Cortex<br>
I thot there was one thru thalami too...<br>
The preceruleus is called PC. Medial septum is called MS. MS drives hipp theta of 2-4-12 HZ (awake or REM). When SWS, MS carries on but hipp ignores.<br>
<br>
MS guys only have GABA, girls also have glutamate. Girls stop wanting to play ball when they are stripped of the glutamate and have only the same incentive as guys (I guess guys learn to enjoy with less incentive to do so?). Could this be the "girls are high all the time" thing? It is a major difference between sexes at possibly consciousness level.<br>
<br>
Some call this the Medial Septum and Diagonal Band of Broca (MSDB).<br>
<br>
Pacemaking MS interneurons express HCN (hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated) channels-> mediate their pacemaker properties. The GABAergic cells of the medial septum that act as theta pacemakers target CA3, CA1, and dentate gyrus interneurons of HIPP.<br>
<br>
Basal ganglia-> muscle learning memory (H.M. example tracing between stars - he could do it better and better each day, but was not cognizant of ever having done it before without his hippocampi).<br>
<br>
Note that when_____showed you the entrance of pettyjohn on her phone, you imagined it facing "west" and more sketchy. Once you walked it, it laid itself out to be facing "north" relative to what you'd imagined, and a very public, upstanding sort of cave.<br>

HIPP seems to contain many memories post childhood, or the keys to unlocking said memories that are still in cortex, or the mechanism for retrieving and playing memories, and/or the mechanism for creating new keys or storing new memories etc. I really think cortex stores the memories, because you can rabbit-trail down a memory and continue to unlock more aspects related in time or space or any other way to that memory - this linking ability I think requires the connectivity and size and storage of cortex. Is there a region of HZ dedicated to certain attitudes of rings such that in that way you get multiple storage areas of same objects and things?<br><br>
If hippocampus can be removed and you be conscious, then rings must be created elsewhere. All you lose with hippocampus is episodic (any long duration of time in past, except childhood) and pretty short term memory (0.5 seconds to 30 minutes into the past). Does the second path (Parabrachial nuclei->Basal Forebrain->Cortex) act as backup so that 2-10 Hz rings still remain, but now they are not put into memory?? Actually H.M. lost his entorhinal cortex which connects hipp to rest of brain - the posterior part of HIPP was left intact.<br>

Does a 3D surface only have a 2D ring component (like horizontal component of a diagonal line) when passing thru time? Or does some 2D (or 2 1/4 D squiggly) plane bisect the 3D surface and where it bisects and which direction it throws it? Does brain create sense of 4th D via "throw" of world and/or "throw" of selector, giving rise to inertial percepts? Or the difference between?<br>

Do neuronal cell bodies have the ability, either via external input causing it to precess to a significant phase say in RF current frequency, or via internal decision to make microtubules vibrate at right rate, for the thing it is signifying to be conscious-ified?<br>
<br>
I think HZ (possibly layer 1, 5, 6) fills in world background info including its spatial stuff (the painted background of bass and drums and music) - this would make sense as its the sensory half;<br>
Cerebellum seems to provide error flagging and possibly future/past and planning thereby and possibly rotation or transduction or spatial 41,253 sense creation with all the 90° stuff in it;<br>
PMC may contain story (highest level, top of chain) (truest You watching Brad play the bass);<br>
PFC (with basal ganglia) may contain filters for learned motor skills like rock climbing and filters for "decisions" or how to read music and play bass like where to put fingers and rhythm and such (since kids have this). Brad playing the bass. This would make sense as its the motor half.<br>
HIPP seems to contain many memories post childhood, or the keys to unlocking said memories that are still in cortex, or the mechanism for retrieving and playing memories, and/or the mechanism for creating new keys or storing new memories etc. I really think cortex stores the memories, because you can rabbit-trail down a memory and continue to unlock more aspects related in time or space or any other way to that memory - this linking ability I think requires the connectivity and size and storage of cortex. Is there a region of HZ dedicated to certain attitudes of rings such that in that way you get multiple storage areas of same objects and things?<br>
Are similar ring orientations next to each other such that you must pass in small steps between rings rather than suddenly?<br>
Still, where is bank? Is bank layer 5,6 and world is layer 2,3 and layer one fills it out at consciousness level?<br>
Changing coffee mug to new attitudes is apparently an intensive task as there is almost a second of lag between desired position, making up mind about exactly what attitude to give, and then imagining coffee cup at that attitude.<br>
Or, is bank layer 5 and attitude of bank is layer 6, and world is layer 3 and attitude of world is layer 2, and representation of whole combo is layer 1? Where are rings? <br>
Or is this handled in a "tiered" cortical manner, such that you have bank at some delineated location in occipital or parietal or temporal cortex, represent it at all attitudes in layer 2,3; have world sensory which truly is represented at all attitudes in layer 2,3 of VC (V1 and prolly V2-4), and layer 1 makes final connection between the two?<br>
Instead of pinwheel axis representing vector attitude, could selected pin or even line meaning being represented at that plane of that pinwheel instead be representing vector attitude? Or better yet, attitude is handled in a relational way between things, just like everything else, with no reference point?<br>
How could you get 3D with just a single phasic differentiation? Or are there 3 bodies of neurons representing 3 axes, and distance relationships between rings enable understanding of which is which (has to be done intuitively without any thinking on person's part, for that is how it happens in real life)? <br>
I suppose you could get a 2 1/2D squiggly ring via phasic plus amplitudinal plus something or a 2D squiggly ring via phasic plus amplitudinal variation.<br>
<br>
Could posterior cingulate be giving sense of violations upon ring and anterior cingulate be giving sense of resistances or responses back, so that cingulate provides that sense of riding the fulcrum between violation and violating? The sense of being an "outside" entity influencing the universe, rather than simply a-willic chemistry? And there would be an entity tho all the filters that comprise the entity were themselves created by chemistry I suppose. Or can we go even more central and say that globus pallidi external, internal, and subthalamic nuclei are final highest chair of ye filters? But remember globus pallidus internal only inhibits the start and stop of a complete action ("open left elbow"); perhaps that is not a problem, if it shares responsibility with cerebellum. It seems you can be conscious of even this fine tuning due to cerebellum if you think about it (focus on it)- hence perhaps any and all neurons have the ability to include themselves into consciousness via some trick (precession to a meaningful phase relative to some pre-determined setter of moment-by-moment focus-consciousness [or even background-consciousness] instantaneous rate, prolly 2-10 Hz for first, or 20-40+ Hz for second; or choice to vibrate microtubules at some magic predetermined rate)- maybe even neurons at proprioception distal locations like hand! Perhaps this explains timing issues of touching hand and brain at same time and being conscious of it prior to being able to touch a button or open mouth to say your conscious, and hand coming prior to brain. Dunno. Might open a can of worms saying distal neurons can be conscious-ified. <br>

Other notes on test - upon opening eyes, horizontality and after image are established immediately; upon closing eyes, it's like the info it's supposed to represent is clearly clashing with position of eyes open after image and so it takes 1-2 seconds to duke it out but internal percept representation location/orientation wins, and by first half second after closing eyes, the two representations have constructive and destructive interference leading to jagging of flag lines to bind both like stair stepping of standing seam metal roof panels on a roof framed with rakes out-of-square to eave if first panel aligned to rake then eave edge has a stair step each time. Second time trying I don't really get jagged lines, but rather it just immediately erases EO image and replaces with EC image at wonky angle. Maybe it's getting wise to me lol.<br>

Here's an idea to see rings sober- spaz fingers at about 12-16 Hz while saccading eyes wildly at about 8 Hz (that's about as fast as I can wildly saccade) while listening to binaural beats about 6.5 Hz. May begin to sense slight sense of rings about 10-16 Hz. Could rings be as fast as 40 Hz sober? I kinda wonder if maybe so cause I can focus and differentiate fingers at pretty fast! Seemingly can differentiate right hand fingers spazzing at 16 Hz and left hand fingers spazzing at say 13 Hz which requires to see at maybe 25 Hz to grasp all stops and starts of all fingers.<br>
Well 5 Hz plus 10 Hz only requires 10 Hz to observe all (if they are aligned in phase). If 10 Hz (halved for analysis) and 5 Hz are exactly half way out of phase, then 20 Hz resolution required. If they are 1/3rd out, 30 Hz required. If they are 1/4 out of phase, 40 Hz required. If they are 1/8 out, 80 Hz. If they are 1/16th out, 160 Hz required. If they are 1/32nd out, 320 Hz required. If they are 1/64th out, 640 Hz required. If they are 1/128th out, 1280 Hz required. Now, I stop being able to differentiate temporal beats @ 
6.5 Hz binaural beats are easy to focus on each beat temporally. 12 Hz it's possible (even 15 Hz), but you get fatigued like looking at flag, and the pulses get "tonified" just like your bass playing got "movified" but not to that extent/clarity. 50 Hz you have a tiny sense/imagination/thinking-you-barely-grasp-it of how fast the pulses are but it is much more tonified and you hear a "quality."<br>
On anther app, I seemingly could hear pulses up to 40 Hz whilst 50 Hz felt 90% tonified and 10% of less sense of knowing rate of pulses. It's like the trading of lower, but frequency knowledge to higher albeit mostly qualia-fied tonified feeling. Could pulse temporal stuff be done by left side of secondary auditory cortex (or higher) and tonified stuff by right side of secondary auditory cortex (or higher)?<br>
Flicking hand anything above 2 Hz you begin to see afterimage of fingers at areas where velocity is highest (middle of flight). About 16 Hz flick you mostly lose knowledge of when fingers start and stop, but rather see them as more solid (low velocity, stopped), and more afterimage (high velocity) without really having knowledge of every start and stop time visually even tho muscles can encode and creating flicking that fast. I still feel like it may provide a ring of focus (sober) about 3 times as fast as this (48 Hz?).<br>
<br>
You know how sometimes when you first wake up and open eyes a split second then close and it's like you can see all these split second images of different color tone going like 40 Hz and even speeding up until you can't tell that reality is being built from these frames. Maybe that is the thing that gets all the way up from 30 Hz to 140 Hz in cortex!<br>
<br>
Layer 1 of cortex seems to provide "filling out" of world scene, including filling out of full audio info, whereas rings only provide focus on one feeling/part. Probably why you're not sure you can hear as well high.<br>
<br>
Areas with highest are: layer 1 cortex, cingulate cortex all layers, hippocampus, substantia nigra, internal globus pallidus, middle frontal cortex, molecular layer of cerebellum. Could cb1 be the yin/yang adjuster between background and focal area? Ie, activate cb1 to repress background info so that focal points are more prominent and distracted from less?<br>
<br>
Dentate gyrus of hippocampus of allocortex (includes hipp, ento, and amygdaloid complex) has a molecular layer with absolute highest binding, similar to cerebellum with pretty high binding in molecular layer, similar to cortex which has highest binding in layer 1 (comparable??).<br>
<br>
What is amygdaloid simply provides scaredy and angry and flighty frames or frames with fast motion within? What if it doesn't "angrify" directly but rather stores frames of that? Or stores IDs (keys) of frames located in cortex? In that way all of hippocampus would be similar. <br>
<br>
Why does hipp have 3 different frequencies incoming? Isn't that a bit unusual? Are the keys complex additives of freqs, perhaps even over a short time such as 1/10th or 1/50th of a second? You lose hipp you lose ability to form new memories (complex frequencies that will unlock a before-traveled path in cortex and "unlock" it?). And you lose ability to access most past memories except childhood. <br>
<br>
Or could keys of three needed freqs be stored in the three parts leading to hipp, and hipp is the place where the constructive and destructive interference happens to complexify the freq before it goes out to cortex to unlock path?<br>
<br>
If so, theta may be adjusted smartly? Or low and/or high gamma must be adjusted smartly?<br>
<br>
Or could hipp have a more functional role, with freqs representing all the known qualities that exist - red, blue, purple+yellow, pockets on front, crown of King, phone screen, filter by angle, Dad opening front door. If so, I bet they could build and emplant a new hippocampus and alzheimers patients would regain all their lost memories as well as the memories they had formed since losing hipp that they didn't even know they had made memories of!<br>
<br>
Novelty has been associated with increased cholinergic levels in hippocampus which may increase fast gamma (slow gamma may be saying "nothing to record here").<br>
<br>
You don't fall asleep like a switch. You enter stage 1 sleep (90% awakened from this said they weren't asleep; "transitional," theta with brief bursts of alpha), then stage 2 sleep (40% said they weren't asleep; alpha bursts die down; further reduction in perception of external stimuli - might hear a word or two), then stage 3 (10% said they weren't asleep), then stage 4 and REM. Stages 3 and 4 are delta.<br>
<br>
What if you could clone your consciousness into a very lightweight thing that could travel into space and radio communicate? Or clone multiple copies? So that you can live forever? What if you could entirely remove all lack of confidence so you are what people want so that you may be treated fairly and understood and rightly appreciated?<br>
<br>
What if you could sync waves of your and clone brain so that you could pass between and see that both were you. What if you could use quantum entanglement of some particles to establish sync even into deep space separation beyond time scale of radio?<br>
<br>
I think audio/vibrational can be written into the rings like movi fied<br>
<br>
Eliminate instability in the physical world set up geons like planets <br>

Large retina sphere observation dimension. Smaller true I observation sphere dimension - two frequencies of microtubules?<br>

Girls, I have so much plausible deniability, I make them do all the liking/risk-taking, yea therefore very little drama, but also very few girlies.<br>
<br>
Observed Consciousness, one step broken down:<br>
3D Bank (3D rotates @ about 6-20 Hz?, but possibly stays mostly oriented "up*" or the waves on it knock it off but it has a "gravity2" which is tending to right it)<br>
Selector Plane of Water (Its "gravity3" attitude can 3D rotate @ possibly 0.0001 Hz, ebb&flow @ 0.25 Hz)<br>
Perhaps 3D bank's rate of 3D rotation changes is tied to rate of Ebb and flow or else the turbulence in the waters. What part of brain would cause turbulence in the waters??<br>
Does size of bank correspond to rate, such that a tiny bank possibly like John's rotates like a sob and even has a vortex?<br>
Does 3D bank stay in place when eyes open but is untethered when eyes closed, which may explain sideways lying American flag thing?<br>
Intersection of selector plane (could be water surface hence 2 1/2 D) with bank and chosen aspects of bank Intersecting with water gives rings of fire (created at 2-10[-20] Hz or maybe higher sober)<br>
Something fills out region around rings "perpendicularaity" but also a little depth, and the whole 3D section of body or whole 3D body and world can be painted in this filling in.<br>
The world is rocked around rotated 3D perhaps scaled and unevenly scaled @ high velocity sometimes, but at same direction change rate as rings 2-10-20+ Hz.<br>
Which way the world was pulled into a ring, its inertia of movement means that ring/world snapshot will "look" like it moves the OPPOSITE direction by the time the next ring appears, creating a sense of tunnel or open-air, depending on whether your focus is interior or exterior of rings.<br>
Something of the inertia of this geometrical abstract body+world being handled and moved by spider, and/or the inertia of ring shape/position/local-size changing from one ring to next over time-- the inertia (given rise via abstract geometry plus time equals movement) creates all qualia.<br>
Hence you have 3D shapes and all that.<br>
Anyway, at least sometimes, and perhaps always, it all gets laid down as a STORY via corkscrew shape of containment "live" clear, painted-upon jello "boxes" @ 2 Hz.<br>
<br>
Observed Preconsciousness<br>
Neural firing patterns, seemingly random, but you see you've interpreted them in a certain way via existence to create a world and self.<br>

Is retinotopic fire together wire together due to close spatio proximity really to blame for seeing such straight lines? Maybe with fovea having high resolution??<br>

You can actually smell after someone does number 2 when dreaming like I woke up right after dream that d___ just got done #2 and I went in powder bathroom (had side door also going to other closet/laundry room) and smelled it just the same as awake. Only difference is it was generated falsely (there was no bad smell in my bed upstairs) internally. You can't smell non-existent stuff when you're awake cause incoming stimuli is pronounced true and overwhelms even if you're trying to imagine smelling after someone does #2. (I wonder if people like j____ or girls in general are better at closing off incoming stimuli and hence better at creativity and imagination and hence are generally more interesting people, whereas guys are programmed to only see external stimuli). I wonder if there are not only focus rings in dream but also background gamma, but you don't remember background just like you don't in real life plus no memory stored of much anything. In fact I think I did see the powder bathroom and doors like closet that hard-push open/closed, so I think there is gamma in dreams. Meaning you are capable of imaging detailed stuff, just real-world stimuli usually preclude doing anything in imagination land. So rings are still going in sleep presumably, but memory storage isn't same. Perhaps rings don't come off bank in sleep (or perhaps they do). Well this presumably would have been REM sleep you witnessed. The funny thing with dreams is that they are like Mexicans and ladders - they don't want it set up accurately - they want it askew- your brain wants to take the perfectly good powder room and act like it has a side door and like the door on front is two poppy doors rather than turning handle knobbed single door, and all kinds of variations. But it had no problem generating the space, and staying true to grid cells and toilet and sink location, and d___ mannerisms - "oh gosh you're not going in there now are you?...Haha"<br>
<br>
Perhaps hallucinatory effects of weed is that it tamps down the switch/filter that allows external (incoming signals) stimuli to dominate, thereby allowing imagination to take off, and rings/background to produce things like clear arrows and straight lines and 3D rooms. Dunno if this switch is thalamus (or those 5 activating sources). That wouldn't make linear sense (as thalamus doesn't have tons of cb1 receptors), but maybe in an incidental way. Or maybe thc antagonizes NMDA and sets up 2 Hz and thus demodulates cortex. Or with 5HT hallucinogens, perhaps it demodulates cortex from activating sources pulse (rf), meaning that incoming stimuli are still there but not integrated as usually should be. Is there a sleep "modulating pulse," say delta? Maybe cortex is always trying to create something, so you demodulate it from sticking to external stimuli and you begin to hallucinate. But what is different between REM sleep and awake? Yes, muscle atonia or forced still rigidity, but what switches between external thalamus and internal creations?<br>
<br>
When you awake from REM, the discontinuity in location is resolved by putting all recent narrative in a bubble named, "ha, you were asleep dreaming!" You can CAST the whole lot of it into the disrepute of "just dreaming" thereby, in a moment, altho brain goes, "wow," for a few moments. (Kinda like born again where you "cast" the whole previous lot of your life into a bubble of disrepute and start anew). Maybe that's partly why dreams get forgotten because if they're not a true representation, you're brain replaces it with what it thinks is true, just like when you see something strange, but once you see what it really is, you can't really go back to seeing the other. Like outline of Africa sideways - you didn't know it was Africa until they said so, but now you can't see it as a random squiggle - the random squiggle generation vanishes from being formed just like dreams vanish from being explored due to "external world is real reality." It's like your brain can only show what it is convinced is real. Or like perception can only arise as the right interpretation of stimuli. Like perception has a perfect conscience and always only sees that which it thinks is, not that which is interesting but which it now knows is not. If experience in sbc wasn't based on legitimate moral reality, you forget it. Prolly why that dude at jobsite can't hardly remember being at bars - cause it's an "illegitimate moral basis" and hence lacks existence lacks reality isn't true so can't stay in imagination. Do people try to give moral filters power-of-instantiation as if a moral filter could be close to or equal with reality-vs-unreality (true-vs-figmentacious).<br>
<br>
The other thing with dreams is that it stays with a story - you were on bathroom story for at least 10+ seconds. The rooms and mood stay consistent even tho parts (like side door) are just made up. Your brain is able to generate a hallucination of a made up room that somewhat models a known room and stay true to that particular made up hallucination while you're continuing to dream!<br>
<br>
Need to do diagram showing rings and states awake and asleep and REM.<br>
<br>
you need to take more responsibility within the dated south like ass are you okay or not that rude but like that your client anything? Anything wonky? Perfum kinda strong. Kinda overweight. But then how?<br>
<br>
What orientation is up given in dreams while on back and while on side? Obviously gravity up in dream, but seemingly corresponding to gravity up in real life.<br>
<br>
Wake EO: theta, alpha, beta, gamma (gamma for visual AND audio, remember? Both do alpha when nothing to process) - inner and outer world hence you form open air <br>
Wake EC: theta, alpha (lessened gamma, but still present for say audio and other stuff) - mostly inner world; perhaps focusing on inside on rings hence you form a solid tunnel <br>
Stage 1 Sleep: theta, with bursts of alpha - inner world <br>
Stage 2 Sleep: theta, very little bursts of alpha except to grab maybe a word here or there <br>
Stage 3, 4 Sleep: you actually would say you were asleep if awakened from this, delta waves - unknown what is here but prolly very slow inner world <br>
"Stage 5" REM Sleep (Dreams): Muscle paralyzation, inner and outer world hence you form open air, this world comes "from your imagination" and is discontinuous (both outer and inner parts) with physical world that rings usually model. Raphe nuclei (serotonin) and locus coeruleus (norepinephrine) INACTIVE, while cholinergic nuclei of the pons-midbrain(higher) junction (acetylcholine) ACTIVE, but on PGO waves not normal waves (non-REM sleep, all three are decreased relative to wakefulness). Theta, alpha, beta and gamma waves present. Background as well as focus present. The qualia the dreams "model" are exactly as real and qualitatively identical (tho not always idetic/perfectly accurate) to the ones experienced awake in the physical world.<br>
<br>
Caffeine seems to make it easier to transition between REM & wake.<br>
<br>
It's like there's a highly qualified time-keeper in your brain, but like me he gets kwashed by the d______ from being paid sufficient attention to. Hence your dreams can model an alarm clock analog right before alarm actually goes off. Like maybe in frames it is saved from previous sun position light amount time of last alarm etc., but thinking precuneate cortex doesn't have access to it or doesn't pay attention to it or doesn't know how.<br>
<br>
To really show someone a dream, you'd first have to put them to sleep from the external world so they could give full attention, then they'd need to experience the same rings/background to get the 3d feel.<br></p> <a href="/rawJournals/trip2.html">Trip 2.</a>
