<h1>Raw Journals: Trip 6</h1>

<p>The following are notes from 4/4/22 (taking two legal hemp gummies) and extra filler added later in contemplation. The reason there are typos is because I swiped it all out with my finger on my iPhone as quickly as I could and didn't want to lose thoughts by going back when iPhone keyboard was being stupid. Some of the things I can no longer tell exactly what word I was going for, so I'm leaving the text alone. I think the most philosophical thought can be gotten from it that way. I add filler here and there to help provide context/meaning. These notes should be taken in a philosophical way - I write everything down that comes to mind without checking it; then I can check and consider the things later. Thus, statements that appear as fact may be me looking at something a certain way and trying it on, but it doesn't mean that I fully agree with it. These notes are more like grasping to try to understand consciousness and just things in general.<br>
<br>
Took 2/3 chill 2/3 euphoria <br>
<br>
And 4/3/22. Start at 5:50 eastern time Providence Canyon GA.<br>
<br>
<br>
Memory of pink sock when close eyes frontoparallel maybe sisters friend gosh prolly 4 yrs old or so. <br>
<br>
Pink pajama outfit of sis about same age 6:27 (5:27 central time)<br>
<br>
"Hello" song by Lionel Richie- words "I love you": you're in tunnel looking up at man on cave wall saying I love you in CMW - the dude can move around live on the ceiling facing you - cave ceiling is can be painted upon. That coronal ring intersects physical world (intersection points may not matter). I think flow is outwards away from body. My friend was driving so going fast forward. Counter-intuitive that flow would be even faster in forwards direction, but okay.<br>
<br>
Almost like CMW has its own 3D body areas skins. That's why you can understand (and feel when vibrating on ring) story.<br>
<br>
(Now ring has shifted from coronal to horizontal [i.e., transverse or axial]):<br>
Horizontal ring in SPW now giving cylinder in CMW (overlays SPW tho ring intersection for focus/drawing to). Rosanna song dude is same AGU (anti-gravity up vector direction) as me at my 3:00 to right. Turn car he stays aligned and fixed to you (if he was "glued" to right speaker, he stayed there during and after the car's turn). Turn head or translate head he stays fixed to space. (FILLER: too bad I didn't try LOOKING my eyes to left or right to see if it moved bank origin!) Bumpy road left or right roll ring stays fixed to you and varies relative to world.<br>
<br>
You're usually not aware of the story being written angel hair it wrote it as drawing an angel from back side with hair flowing down. Everything has such a story to it little bits of story. FILLER: why language, and everything, is fundamentally just changing geometries.<br>
<br>
Attitude (vector orientation of the ring) is not under prowess of will.<br>
<br>
You're taking off, off of 2D intersection with SPW, 2D rings which could be saved in memory. And that choice of 2D ring is drawing a story for future use. Even with eyes open, only a 2D slice recorded.<br>
<br>
The universe needn't exist - just paint in fake colors to all observers of it. FILLER: This is a philosophical point, not an entirely true point. I do think the real universe of matter exists, just it doesn't have to. It is possible to create our same consciousnesses without it.<br>
<br>
Felt Hotter is a faster vibration in story than colder Temps. FILLER: This would make sense that part of what gives cold its feel is the DAMPENING of vibrations of ring (the freezing and sticking of self — a danger) in addition to the 3D mental imagery. Here the "inertial hits" is more like the "absence" of hits — a somewhat scary dampening of vibrations and of life. Heat then would be a scary excitotoxicity at extreme levels.<br>
<br>
Kickout thrust can model inertial feel. (Or ring throw itself from origin??). FILLER: Ring Walk is another "character" I should have included in my list. It's when you can see that the ring that prints the SPW walks (in the perceptual space of SPW) say one foot each ring. So, you can have a certain degree of FLOW and a certain degree of WALK from one ring to the next. But often there is little or no "walk," but rather only "kick-out" "flow."<br>
<br>
It (FLOW) is an attitude change of "story-man" (well, the paster 3D frames of him CAN change attitude, but don't have to — they could simply translate in some direction).<br>
<br>
Finer vibrations don't matter that much they just paint the last resolution bits of meaning of story drawn out. FILLER: Perhaps this is why the brain can get by understanding sound frequencies above 1,000 Hz where neurons can fire fast enough to represent the sound (or especially above say 4,000 Hz where they cannot even "phasically lock" in a sort of artificial way to generate 4,000 Hz firing from 4 separate neurons agreeing to stagger themselves somewhat temporally) — the fact that all this higher frequency sound simply does less and less "flapping" of the ring printhead means inaccuracies don't really matter as the prefrontal cortex (or whatever reads consciousness) wouldn't even have the "mental visual acuity" to see the inaccuracy in the first place. Remember that all that has to be done in consciousness is draw the story of "that which currently is" faithfully enough that PRC (or whatever) can read and grasp all the meaning trying to be conveyed. It doesn't have to be perfect, just sufficiently useful for the sake of CONVEYING MEANING of "that which currently is."0<br>
<br>
Pink may be a compilation of pink associational memories - blowses and what not. FILLER: yea it's a skewer, but also it seems there must be some mechanism (like with hot/cold) for why pink feels pink.<br>
<br>
You could paint any frame from any ring<br>
<br>
the bank is just like stack of physical frames ie rings ie ring shapes that can be used.<br>
<br>
Elements of story are painted with a discretionary use of rings from said ring stack.<br>
<br>
That part of ring has to be blue which reps a blue part of scene. FILLER: I dunno, maybe man. Maybe the cursor uses a transformed "star cluster" like moved from pupil outward 2' or whatever to get to center of bank, then go from there and transform it for use at each point on ring.<br>
<br>
Each sep thing like color(?) and temp could be set aside as painting in 90° outwards from previous ring. FILLER: dunno, maybe man.<br>
<br>
Walking on sidewalk didn't feel like cave created felt like open air. FILLER: There seems to be two or three ways to use rings — hollow out the inside (creates a "cave" with writing on the walls drawing world), or make 3D puzzle pieces (give sense of solidity of body), and possibly an even more "open-air" use say if you're walking outsicde.<br>
CMW felt like cave very often.<br>
FILLER: So maybe we can posit three worlds: the SPW is "open-air," the ring intersects it somewhere. Viewing the ring from inside out can allow viewing of CMW. Viewing the ring from outside in can allow viewing of BPW (body perceptual world).<br>
FILLER: If the ring prints the SPW (probable), then it's just ONE STORY that it prints, but it has a myriad of ways it can do it, and it can FOCUS on "real world" (SPW), "mental world" (CMW), or "your body" (BPW). These can even lap (be a little correlative i.e. simultaneously firing in the brain) or be entirely anti-correlative (one THEN the other) (temporally spaced).<br>
<br>
Rings of Fire: The Subconscious Cartoons That Make You Conscious (/Give You Most Qualia)<br>
<br>
Filter by Horseshoe shape that word filter(and that brain mechanism) is THE STORY I'm saying you're saying! In 2D but having all these extra meanings! It is filtering (from the 3d painted world it's making) a 2d ring. Painting a 3D intended model with a ring set at an attitude. Which can emphasize things like...<br>
AGU is whichever way it needs to be in story in the meaning relative relationships <br>
And it just has to draw the amplitudes of waves for sounds frequency (??)<br>
<br>
The glass can get broken up completely if need be and shake still be there - it's just story!back half of a cup (CMW) attached to back of phone (SPW) KEY KEY KEY!!! (FILLER: I think I meant that the back of phone within SPW was intersecting down the long axis of a glass in CMW and since bank was leaky while high I could see the whole bank printhead, not merely what was getting drawn in CMW). BUT IT'S A WHOLE 3D+T story being glued to SPW. And yea the axis of story (CMW) AGU can vary 41.253 SD relative to SPW AGU. There's always a new the new story 3d being drawn upon 2d selection ring of current story's 3d. Thus hard to follow while sober. Story may move faster thru rings than rate and total direction of ring movement. The story is getting kicked out in this spirograph of 3d puzzle pieces or story painting frames. It's just so these frames are close to each other in shape. Very unrelated things make these frames (=rings) such as brocolli and pizza and countertops (sudden orientation change on that one!) see the length of the frames doesn't matter that much but the story they are painting! The rings so happen to be close in shape in order to paint something out with meaning given or read 90° to that ring. So the meaning of the frames is mostly lost and subconscious (!!!). But yes you paint by memory frame. Longer (Memories as you think of them) are painted from lengthened iPhone live ones (frames) and associated short normal frames. Which may paint another story. I guess hemp you can stretch the frames out. Story is definitely going out my butt right now. It's just a direction of laying frames. The inner eye can have good resolution! It's a story so brain writes it that way. As story gets off line in topic it peels itself off like an onion skin to give bare nakedness to new focus story item. You think you can't go from Rogers neighborhood to basketball you can- Rogers hands, hands morph to onto basketball, basketball. It's a morph between mental image that brain does.<br>
FILLER: Wow, that is a lot to handle. So, the proposition is that you draw a CMW 3D movie about what you're thinking about using ring shapes from memory frames (3D video clips or stationary 3D images) that JUST SO HAPPEN to have the right needed (or pretty close) SHAPE, and ignore the fact that they are SLIGHTLY TRIGGERING old memories. In this way, these memory frames (you were only trying to get the ring shape therefrom) keep you glued to your roots. Interesting. Apparently it might be one way the brain paints. Dunno if it's the only way.<br>
<br>
Btw the ring is ethereal it isn't black or white.<br>
<br>
Scents could be patterns of 2 little square waves 2 longer square waves for a particular smell like cigarette. Smell is an element of story you like you are. Smells you have frames associated with the thing. It used cigarette smelling as frames (as story conveyed within frames) for me itching my ear the 2d intersection rings with my body were playing Marlboro man movie from center of ring/cylinder outwards.<br>
FILLER: I guess the smell of cigarettes (wafted my way) was joined with the disparate sense of scratching ear in this way.<br>
<br>
It has your whole body and movements as a concept to build upon for incoming stimuli. Like for itching my ear, had to use rings tracing my physical body but at the same time they were already there as a Marlboro man cartoon. You should see neurons relating to a 2d slice thru part of your body firing together, always. Or they should always make a 2d slice where they are repping by firing. Rings change attitude as they need to for story, sometimes rocking up awhile, then mostly down for awhile. Up in coronal. Could be inhibitory neurons are the ones painting by reducing from full radius. Meaning of story drives attitude 3d change. The story moves around so that ring can be drawn with variance of a single value alone - intensity- the rest is done by brain making a 3d-attitude changing story. The finger moving in story gives it the sense of Inertia. The finger movement may be frontoparallel and the rings be coronal and rings getting laid down closer to your face. The box is conceptual and is done as a conception. So how can story exist as being read?<br>
<br>
Prediction: neurons often fire in a plane - the neurons aren't in a plane, but the places they instantaneously rep ARE in a plane. Whether these neurons are in cerebellum or motor or sensory cortex I don't know.<br>
<br>
Ring plus small amount of time dimension measure gives 3d puzzle piece. KEY! SPW.<br>
<br>
Things that need <br>
<br>
Memory of tilting yaw coffee mug back and forth done with 2d intersection rings with rand rising to tilt coffee cups various ways. Hence you must do before you can see/visualize/imagine. Build frames of concomitant plane of body because it is concomitant planes (rings) that draw everything.<br>
<br>
Maybe cerebellum helps determine what are 2d planar intersections of body and objects so as to use in imagination like rising hand with coffee cup.<br>
<br>
Brain hence needs to know STORY as the binding idea. Then every digit adds a tiny bit to this story being mentally made percepted. As well as how it is rolling AGU compared to SPW AGU. THE WHOLE BRAIN (or at least the PHZ) is doing nothing but one thing - solving the binding problem of writing a helpful story with this data that just ones and zeros over time <br>
<br>
Filler: could rings be around axons of corpus callosum, and shearing off from plane be deviations from cross section?<br>
<br>
Taco shells used too <br>
<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>
You don't usually need detail in rings. To see the fine resolution text here small in scale requires a bit more writing skill. Just write the letter on the cave wall. <br>
<br>
Rings of Fire: Cartoon Consciousness <br>
Rings of Fire: Cartoon Cave Consciousness<br> 
<br>
The ability to move on from any ring shape back to default mode or something else is useful and brain spends a lot of effort figuring this out.<br>
<br>
All people imaginate and it can be useful. Without a filter and with decent content or content that makes others feel at home or meets some of their need, that person will be fun.<br>
<br>
Things could be passed between brain regions packed up like this in a single digit on off representing 3d realm via only rotation around ring of bit but the story it models moving therefrom. Maybe the info has a special code to say current rate and attitude and attitude change and rate of attitude change, like DNA or like computer storage.<br>
<br>
The shift of angle of phone text relative to ring means ring bumps it up a touch more at left upper side in coronal plane. And creates viewer at angle (which world inside that namely is the physical universe)(there such models it). You is more the reader of the whole story.(Viewer at angle ie when viewer is different from attitude of ring itself). Hence also making it difficult to see ring that brain is writing to when sober. It can only write to a ring at a time. Filler: I think not I think you also have paster and futurer rings.<br>
<br>
Time travel is when you create and look downwards suddenly cause that had to get built into story being out of plane I mean really it builds up to it before as it's coming to it, but it isn't known until in story. So rotation is like time travel or time stretching. Right now saggital but slanted to left ear pointing away to right fov frames and the text I'm reading intersection is the important thing on ring. Now you see on and off going from black to white on text is on and off.<br>
The word stretching - frames writing the word stretching are used and the movie cartoon therein is mickey and somebody stretching rubber (a 2d intersection with that 3d movie cartoon). CMW seems more black and white or etheric than SPW. But when eyes open paying attention to physical world model, you do see color well. <br>
OR maybe brain knows how to take a slide and change it to make different shape while maintaining meaning in story?<br>
How to imprint predicted text onto rings you're using. The on and off TIME DURATION sets the  keen accuracy of seen stuff like this text. And it's proper attitudinal shift from plane of cylinder wall is also governed by that. That's why I mean it's incredible - the resolution and skill computation power needed for that is crazy!<br>
So bank is bank of physical shape ring ideas. Then real time spinner paints it.<br>
So this is the spinner! That speeds up or down with certain drugs. All your brain that is painting by all timing out one painting made against ring from cylinder inside. The fact there is a ring is implied by the story painted by 1D firings! And the fact that "it" (story) is moving around 3D attitude. So your focus really only is on one 2d plane altho may be a cartoon embedded in it.<br>
Stories painting stuff out are very very quickly alternating 4 per 2 heartbeats (about 4 Hz it's the story that matters). Maybe you can read brains by reading the 1D intensity and trying to build a spinner cycling at certain rate making ring (cycles of ring and rate of change of Attitude of cartoon world and of rings (?)), and that cartoon world changing attitude relative to it.<br>
<br>
1,2,3,4- rings cylinders laid top to bottom about 4 (-5) times in 2 heartbeats. Maybe this is how 3d painted. Of course the guy in front of building gets drawn in front of building - building is backwards in time. But okay cause memory. (Rings keep firing for a little bit for immediate memory). And that story shrinks as it becomes past 3 deciseconds. So maybe immediate 0.5 second memory is rewriting the frames smaller and continuing story. Or maybe you become more hallucinatory under  than usual visualization level but that is hallucination too. Or id say sober, it's smoothed out to where it (meaning of story) is felt and cushy and therefore not even noticed except the little trace of feel ie qualia ie movement thru frames. You dont see (notice sober) how it is paint by frame. Just clip a little off a frame now and again to make a notch for letters of a word.<br>
<br>
This (CMW) isn't created by thc. This is really how your brain lays consciousness down. Slowed up (kinked up with thc), you get choppier more noticeable 3d puzzle edges cause longer exposure so not as refined story sense as sense of the thing creating it.<br>
<br>
All brain has to know how to do is vary intensity over time and story meaning arises from it almost supernaturally! But we do have a lot of practice!!<br>
<br>
Would pinwheels or purkinje cells help establish current plane/attitude if they fired at a certain time? Sure. Or even utricles etc? Maybe! Or does neuron pattern in head naturally map onto head being a certain direction? Wait. It doesn't need it for that - it needs it for the Inner work of instructing neurons when to fire to explain internally certain spatial things in story. <br>
<br>
Maybe cerebellum IS CMW. And cerebrum is SPW with both motor planning and 3d physical world.<br>
<br>
It's like a watering (high I said "rain") spitzer, but spitzing in 3 attitudinal dimensions now just 2 (arcing) like usual. FILLER: The 3D cursor drawing rings is like a 3D grass sprinkler.<br>
<br>
I don't know if SPW built from ring slices thru cylinder (perpendicular to ring) from top to bottom over and over, or if it closes in at top like a sphere (w crown of head being top of sphere). It's like rings within rings. Or higher freq drawing top to bottom, and lower freq drawing fewer frames of it or just the one center intersecting ring.<br>
<br>
Whatever freq of ring you're drawing against - just need to know that freq then precess from if (?)<br>
<br>
There's always a region of rising Crest that takes over drawing of amplitude on current place on ring. Brain waves could be drawing letters. For D there's longer duration wave needed at top of D as rings in cylinder are going.<br>
<br>
Right eye open just has dull drey color. Left eye open has full stereo of dark and dull grey (left and right eye inputs even if made up. Both eyes open there's more light grey but still both).<br>
<br>
Wait it's like whichever eye you have open awhile then switch to new eye the new eye is greyed out on new content. But after time open it too becomes dark and lighter grey patches (refinement by memory??). Like blacker connected to more memories of other extra eye?<br>
FILLER: Or maybe more THC made it to the circuitry of one eye or the other, and you were seeing perceptually how the ocular dominance columns were laid out and patches of lighter grey on letters were made by more thc-inhibited eye circuit!<br>
FILLER: As a note, THC acts as an inbibitor mostly — within the cortex (and everywhere), the cb1 receptors are retrograde (not prograde), resulting in LESS GLUTAMATE being released from neurons which might lead to less firing of post-synaptic neurons and hence less filled out colors (color beginning to look more transparent).<br>
<br>
American flag afterimage?? - I didn't say you couldn't have cylinder of rings repping SPW in eyes closed. Just not as active, duh.<br>
<br>
Doesn't matter there's a break if you get to the next wacky plane at New divergent!! attitudinal angle.<br>
<br>
Could precursing paint color? It would eat it's own tail as required! Say against local 40 or 80 Hz cycle? Or the richness set up harmonics by putting at midpoint vs 1/3 the way? Both hemispheres get there simultaneous moment to paint their version on, or maybe it partly splits moment my moment or small shape by shall shape?<br>
<br>
Is color the pattern and activation level of the three color cones in retina?<br>
<br>
Is the broken glass the lateral geniculate nucleus, the peach is the retina, the v1 is the box corner? FILLER: Is their shapes conducive to somehow creating a pattern of neural firing to encode the shapes of cylinder, sphere, and cube?<br>
FILLER: It is said (Llinas) that every neuron from retina (sphere) to LGN (cylinder/broken glass) is timed with different speeds of action potential so as to arrive at LGN at exactly the same time, even for the slightly longer paths. If so, could the speed of AP or this timing thing somehow help to encode sphere and cylinder shapes?<br>
<br>
Or thalamus the broken glass? Cerebrum the sphere, cerebellum the box? Of bank.<br>
<br>
One cycle (freq) can help entrain another. Absolute 2D connection ring (4Hz) can help entrain the TV flows of cylinder (4 Hz but maybe really more like 40-80Hz?).<br>
<br>
Attitude is maintained by story!!!! That is the crazy thing. The whole of brain is working together towards one or two or three variables to be included in the story it is writing. <br>
<br>
The story says oh hi gun you're painting slinging out this ring at this attitude and we're changing to this other attitude. The bits only make sense in this spinning and 3d rotating way. And both stories written simultaneously. But ring shape between them is shared!<br>
<br>
Now here's a thot what if time itself is spinning out and created by every Crest or lull of a distance wave? Or vice versa? Maybe that's too far.<br>
<br>
The gun spits out at its own, but rings mandated by a certain part of brain which is shared with cartoon world to draw anything needed there.<br>
<br>
Yea you can have 3-d toe wiggle on bank but still you can and do select a 2d ring from it.<br>
<br>
Got cold as flat line on top of coronal ring again, but it was cause drinking cold cranberry juice and it was the flat line of cold liquid in my mouth in a coronal ring just tracing the cold liquid. But maybe that memory frame ie meaning painted within is feeling of cold.<br>
<br>
Prolly why you felt colder and wanted to shiver high in olive garden. Cause cartoon world more convincing when rings lose their fine detail. With fine detail, SPW more (only) noticed, with very faint feelings only from cartoon world.<br>
<br>
Religion (bad religion that is, but quite common) makes you not feel for animals and others. It makes you focus exclusively on the (SP) world! And pay no attention to your heart - your conscience - your gut - your feelings (cartoon depictions giving a sense of worth to an animal's life or giving the morality to any moral choice). Hemp forces you to look at your humanity - your soul - your unification with animals and others - the fact that it is inhumane to ignore the pleas of help of another human or animal.<br>
<br>
Religion teaches you to blindly trust the writings of a book found in SP (serpentine) world and ignore the weightier matters of the heart (actual, meaningful, rubber-hits-the-road, ethics).<br>
<br>
Religion teaches to dismiss self-made cartoons depicting the ill-advised nature of a certain rule and teaches you to ignore how it goes against the universal, ultimate, highest, "God" conscience. So religion is anti-God when it is in this form. True, good "religion" is that which comports best with every cartoon scenario.<br>
<br>
So do we see patterns in brain that are repeating or nearly repeating over the 1 second time scale say 3-10 times? And other stuff that is similar at 40 or 80 Hz corresponding duration? I think so cause individual neurons and nearby ones do indeed fire in this manner of slow then speed up then slow again.<br>
<br>
True religion is he who follows the Inner Christ light if you will. But it is the Inner one. The inner conscience! <br>
<br>
Paint by frame some frames have their story at random very odd angle to other frames and your current body position. Just like 6+/heartbeat. (Filler: 12 Hz??)<br>
<br>
CMW observation: I can dissociate from speed tempo of mario bros iii songs playing in my head and drawing cartoon out. Even weird profile sonic the hedgehog spikey hair -it's cross section can be the ring shape on part of ring. And vibrations playing out Mario iii. And whole selection thing can morph in 3d differentially to sonic's movements. And observation angle can change.<br>
<br>
Maybe to use a proper ring to make memory, brain has to look at 3d memory (!!) then make selection therefrom which comports with needed ring (DG has 3d memory, or 3d conceptualization inside DG granule cells from brain cerebrum info, then a selection is taken off at CA3 which is then used to paint in CA1 for present moment?).<br>
<br>
Like cerebrum stores 3d memories as best as it can. Hippocampus connects cerebrum with cartoon (cerebellum?)?<br>
<br>
Longer memories tend to be 3d video snippets.<br>
<br>
Yellow is the highest frequency most attention???<br>
<br>
The variance of drawing on ring is very smart - the story it draws by turning on and off (story) is itself spinning and such.<br>
<br>
In looking at bottom left pic (of google search images of colors one of which looked like a rug) frames were flat with surface of bed then a single frame flipped out modeling that thing not as cross section but as head on is looking GravityDown upon a rug (so like rug is rocked up to be at right angle).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Thought light on side of door was coming from left side of door, but then realized it is from right and had to adjust my spatial model in prolly half a decisecond or less! Cool.<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>

It's almost like each color is bringing up memories from that color and that provides feel of color.<br>
<br>
It's almost like in a tiny speck of color there are tiny little memory worlds superimposed to give that feel from memory shapes/objects.<br>
<br>
You get synesthesia because you may paint pink color with memory frames of smelling pink bruise medicine (calamine lotion!!). The story of pinky stuff painted.<br>
<br>
Color by phase angle of 80 Hz stuff?? With visual drawn at 40 Hz? Almost like we need more Hz. Cause still need cylinder. If need 40 subrings per cylinder, then need 160 Hz there alone, maybe more. Maybe there ARE faster frequencies, just written into story, and it doesn't look like a brain frequency even tho brain is accounting for and allowing precision to catch it. Remember with cerebellum, can have precision to 1 microsecond supposedly, and what spatial resolution (not that that's needed except perhaps for doing math work to correlate CMW to SPW)?<br>
<br>
Maybe how many myelin sheath sausage links are on a neuron are for something like color? Or thickness could micromanage timing?? Or duration? Does inertial stuff happen more or some in dendrites? Or at synapses mostly? Could ball size indicate color? (Serotonin one, glutamate white, gaba black, or thc black etc??).<br>
<br>
Whole 3d front of body outline can be drawn with cylinder skin and highlight that "plane" rather than true plane which is currently frontoparallel (my head is on pillow).<br>
<br>
You get good at thinking because you build abstract models.<br>
<br>
Story writes whether you should read CW or CCW but it may not even matter.<br>
<br>
Even a corkscrew spiral at its central meeting reducing plane is a 2D ring! So I think okay to call it 2D.<br>
<br>
Rings of Fire: The Brain Language (Mechanism?) of Conscious Story<br>
<br>
Turning when being driven in car is built into the story printed on inside surface of sphere.<br>
<br>
What neurotransmitter does cerebrum (PHZ) have that cerebellum lacks/has in very short supply? That could be color neurotransmitter. FILLER: LOL, doubt it! I think color is painted by some finer patterning of on/off when ring is going (or some patterning of zig/zag axial or radial movement of 3D cursor while drawing ring).<br>
<br>
Or perhaps sense of color is inertial twist of rhodopsins. And perhaps people are conscious percepts at retina, but don't report if broken connection along chain. FILLER: Nice thots, but I doubt it!<br>
<br>
Walking up hill in neighborhood remembered sand between toes from yesterday at Providence Canyon, but that was flat so AGU had mental image of as if ground were flat (ie the hill pitched down for the mental foot) so both AGUs would be aligned.<br>
<br>
Walking down sidewalk it's almost like shoe surface prints on ground are bottom of a large basketball that rolling in whatever net direction you're going by measure of footprint movement. And layer is peeled off and it's the meeting between world of SPW and body of SPW. Or perhaps world+body of SPW and 3d outline of CMW which is currently modeling your body 3d outline but you see the intersection plane can be totally planar - it approaches to that and also actually gets there. Heel of foot is thrown off at first followed by toe of foot but whole story is thrown backwards so even tho foot gets high, only the first moments of heel stepping off are modeled in the rolling basketball. It makes it easier to model. <br>
Kinda like if there was mud between two worlds and it cakes and then gets hot and dry and cracks up into alligator cracks due to strain of going from planar to spherical underside of basketball.<br>
Maybe the "casting back in time" that scientists speak of is that sensory stimuli was felt when it happened at retina or hand and then when brain writes it, it has to write it on a paster-tense frame to keep up with present moment. (Or sweep ring attitude backwards to "grab" that bit of data that is now known and focused on but also known to have happened slightly previously hence the sweep [is this a sweep in kicking out?]). The brain predicts the future only in this all encompassing sense that the story it writes is pretty freaking spot on temporally with real world. And it only has to draw out ring of current focus at each split moment. A Frick ton goes into getting ready to write, and the meaning of frames and such, but the actual writing of consciousness is a fairly simplistic task that could be easily done by a computer program to vusually emulate consciousness. <br>
These pigment proteins belong to a family known as the opsins. The pigment protein in rods is called rhodopsin, while the pigment protein in cones is called iodopsin. A single rod can contain up to 100 million molecules of rhodopsin in its outer segment discs. <br>
<br>
Rhodopsin molecules contain seven transmembrane domains and somewhat resemble metabotropic synaptic receptors in their structure. In fact, rhodopsin can be regarded as a receptor protein whose agonist is already bound to it. This agonist is a molecule called retinene (or retinal) that is derived from Vitamin A. It is bound to the middle of the seventh transmembrane domain of the rhodopsin molecule. More specifically, it is the 11-cis form of retinene, which, when it absorbs light, isomerizes to the all-trans form. This isomerization converts the rhodopsin to its active form, metarhodopsin II. This reconfiguration of the retinene molecule thus produces the same effect as if a neurotransmitter had suddenly bound to a receptor.<br>
From thebrain.mcgill.ca. <br>
<br>
When you open eyes, eyes are drawing out immediately a world, forcing CMW to come in closer in meaning (and sometimes physical proximity or planarity) as desired.<br>
<br>
It's almost like iodopsin seven transmembrane protein the seven things are strings holding a thing that can switch between thin and fat. The blue cone have more iodopsin that is such that it takes a higher freq to vibrate the strings one single pulse out so as to allow retinal to switch and reset up in fat configuration. Those strings are stretchy to high freq. Others like red cone have more iodopsin that is a little varied in amino acid sequence such that it vibrates a single pulse open at lower freqs (long wavelength). Could it be that there is also a time duration difference, with red represented by small amount of activation of lowest freq cones so a little bit of long pulses? And purple would be a little bit of short pulses with nothing else? And yellow would be repped by max long pulses combined with nearly max medium pulses but essentially zero short pulses? <br>
Green repped by nearly max medium length pulses, about half of max long length pulses, and a tiny bit of short pulses.<br>
Do you think high, since having trouble modeling normal, it resorts to (or to more of) mental imagery stuff? But that would still help to reveal sober stuff cause could still be same mechanism just hidden from view.<br>
Fine high sonic vibrations are easy to paint - it's less movement in side of cave wall.<br>
Dua lipa want to song - mouth singing given at part of ring modeling dua mouth. Kick drum vib given at lower part of ring modeling that.<br>
Can use guitar amp as cartoon thing modulate and write sonic vibrations on.<br>
SPW and CMW can be superimposed spatially like ring of feet on pavement upwards is CMW outline of body and ring of feet on pavement intersection -upwards stuff is also SPW world+body. Throwing out past 3dframes of CMW behind and anticipating it coming in you can "draw" many useful things like feet coming off sidewalk etc.<br>
You eat healthy to extend your story. That's some serious long term planning!<br>
When you see stuff that isn't there, like blinds pinching up at some point when they're not, or drain spinning CW slowly when it wasn't, is done via CMW but also done via the fact that CMW can get oriented differentially to SPW and thereby present a sense of motion via attitude angle when head-on there is no movement. Like CMW plane went yawed (left side away from me and right side hinge side); AGU up SPW and CMW stayed up and parallel or mostly aligned.<br>
When you're on your side, it feels like AGU is slanted CCW, so when eyes close (Visual cues of true AGU gone), it slants flag to orientation it prefers as being AGU. Prolly just a function of utricle or semi circular thingys being imperfect in that plane, and may vary from person to person (Dad's may be better).<br>
AGU is like the brain's North Pole for 3D existence. The whole righting reflex based on it, too! Early in evolutionary history.<br>
I guess eye floaties could be something on eye surface. Or in fluid somewhere.<br>
The funny thing is that story can exist at all. Smells and all these qualia are drawn by cartoon depiction, but in undrawable story they exist (brain only draws touching outlines of story, but story itself can arise from the cartoon depictions that you'd think would be meaningless a priori). <br>
The way the two spheres interact (SPW, CMW), you could poke a skewer in both at each's AGU and it's like you're always looking at those two worlds in that way.<br>
Recall too that if you build a brain reader, the fundamental ring that is being drawn out it varies perhaps. Perhaps that doesn't matter. But maybe at 4 Hz or maybe at 10-20 Hz there is something.<br>
It seems this 3d sprinkler needs to be able to paint black to white (to clear? Or also have opaque-to-translucent filter?) and red loop back upon itself (colors), as well as spatial distance in. And the story itself has its own attitude but that's already math completed to brain as it is painting. And it's something that the story forces 3d angle of. It only makes sense if the story you interpret from it is facing a certain way relative to you-looking-upon-physical-world-(and-it).<br>
The brain is always painting with this 3d sprinkler (two brains going at once). Could right side be doing the CMW (hence face recognition on that side wait it said hallucination via simulation) and left side the SPW?<br>
Call SPW "Stimuli Physical World"??<br>
You could get translucent with a sagittal or horizonal (or inbetween) plane with a different spatial place for each object in intersection. Alternatively, They could be embedded into a partially coronally-made cave wall. Stuff (story?) gets kicked out so stuff in middle of ring like iPhone or translucent crystal or whatever gets a chance to be written in a split moment like it could be sheared like a slinky so that middle of screen and back a bit is given by right side of ring it's jettisoned "past". Any depth away from eye could be written into (painted onto in meaning ie size) cave wall. I think this is more accurate meaning of cylinder I spoke of earlier - more like a sheared slinky, but it could be more rectilinear in upright form.<br>
CMW doesn't really have color to speak of its the funny thing. That it can do it all with cartoon outlines is pretty remarkable. Again like that camera that can navigate in 3d at big concerts. Could color be instruction to paint thru memories of shapes of that color or frames with that color very fast like 40/80 Hz?? But why would it have such a consistent feel from moment to moment if it relied on very differring frames like that? I think you can link memories via that, but the actual painting of the color is I think done perhaps at retina or LGN or V1 or what do scientists say? at V4 connection area? And maybe on right side?<br>
Maybe retina, LGN, and V1 provide geometric shapes for use in rings/frames. Hence why (if these are the bank) why bank feels colorless and merely geometrical. <br>
Even if both eyes open gives you a sorta wonky field of view, it still maps to a sphere surface so that SPW feels like sphere. It's like you get one unified eye you're looking with. But focusing on near vs far that's something to think upon.<br>
By moving retina around to all 41,253, brain links idea of sphere of existence and sphere gets stored in bank. By moving corner of V1 to all corners of a cube, you make a cube (cube stored in brain). By moving LGN bend ("genu") to varius things you can model a break in a glass cup or whatever else. I don't know how it models a needle point but it does somehow.<br>
So the brain "checks in" at a few points - dips down to hipp (rsp) and back, dips to cerebellum and back, proprioception comes dips to muscles and touch comes back, dips to basal ganglia/thalamus and back, stuff arises from RF.<br>
Dipping to cerebellum honestly appears to be means of tightening up muscular (piano) or mental performance.<br>4
Dipping to basal ganglia appears to <br>
Could AGU actually be real gravity pulling on you cause your perceptual world is upside down and left to right?<br>
Why is it that with hallucinogens, one can ostensibly see color in CMW, even overpowering sometimes the input from eyes with eyes open!? <br>
Placing the flute, guitar, voice on STH was a SPW thing and there was one ring with intersection plane perhaps coronal going thru all three if need be (or draw on sheared cave walls). Image of dua lipa and kick drum and bass amp vibrating was a coronal ring could feel bass in gut cause ring vibrating bass there in that section that overlapped with CMW version of my gut of my body, but wasn't really WHERE sound was coming from for each component necessarily, altho it tried to keep up at least with dua location.<br>
It scrunched it down to make the room bigger (Light coming from right, not left, side of door).<br>
mGlu2 (pre-synaptic!) may be how 3 causates color in CMW. Does smaller amount of neurotransmitters released paint color??<br>
Maybe CMW doesn't have enough frames to paint color? But with certain drugs it may?<br>
Maybe inhibiting frames means there more neurons that can fire at faster rate cause so many aren't getting used up in each fire so inhibitory drugs like thc and _ actually speed up frame rate of CMW maybe even to speed of ability to paint cartoon in color!<br>
There's a dominant eye, right? And I think it is the one that gives peach shape in back by default.<br>
Cats and dogs are the next closest creatures to evolving with humans to apical heights.<br>

It's almost like cold is more of a threat than hot so heat is like wholeness and have to maintain and cold is deviations from or attacks to stasis.<br>
<br>
So what switches between puzzle pieces and cave walls? Cave walls seems to be in CMW, right? Maybe SPW lays down puzzle pieces (past to future still painted) and CMW lays down sections of cave, with same rings? And the intersection of vantage point is ring?<br>

Meter of song is existent because it exists in the etheric story. Think of sound octave as halving of rate of writing on cave wall. <br>
<br>
Could intensity of colors /lights be several octaves of high freq color? Prolly not cause colors are never misplaced (brain never puts red accidentally for green as would happen with thc if it were like that [just a precision in timing thing]).<br>
<br>
The neuron dendrite shafts where connection is made (2D plane, ring) between layers 2,3 and layer 5 are repping the ring; where layers 2,3 are doing their own thing independent of layer 5 is SPW. Where layer 5 is doing its own thing is CMW. (?)<br>
<br>
Or could be layers 2,3 make both SPW and CMW and planar junction is done by cerebellum??<br>
<br>
Could hipp with 3 rates incoming be rate of Attitude change of story, rate of kick out of story (attitude change?), and rate of change of ring? With movement of attitude of story being most central and important?<br>

Happy outlook(and motivation) such as you have while high or in a good mood - that seems to transcend story or be elsewhere repped.  <br>

Remember dua lipa ring with voice, kick, and bass? You weren't drawing sound of tires going down road. That's explains the phenomenon scientists call conscious deafness to things you exclude from focus.<br>
<br>
Paster frames is more like "you are tuning out your attention here" and futurer rings are like "you are starting to get interested here this is the direction."<br>
<br>
It's almost like purkinje cell DENDRITES choose what to focus on what ring, and which purkinje cell... Wait, maybe ring can be across multiple PCs?<br>
<br>
Ring is 2D because it is a CURRENT snapshot of differential movement of CMW relative to SPW. Movement meaning movement thru time, even if the paster and futurer rings are somewhat of a construction and not entirely true to time reality. The bisection of the two attitudes?<br>
<br>
I think ring stays in place and in attitude even as you turn head around in bed (ring seemed to be parallel to back wall of room ie wall nearest pillow), and I was laying sideways facing safe, and heard thunder drawn on cave ceiling/wall, and ring seemed to stay in place even rolling onto back and lifting head to like you're standing.<br>

Babe by Styx dude is attitude being moved around from facing you at 2:00 to 10:00 and sometimes a little off center. Often sound is painted with a 2D cartoon outline of physical thing making sound. Why visually pleasing stage performance artists are more memorable and enjoyable- it gives brain frame//ring/outline-shape visualization tools for drawing sounds. FILLER: Sort of like how Aldous Huxley, in taking mescaline, said he realized that everybody gets their personality by "over-acting" their favorite cartoon character (all about these cartoonish 2D geometrical form movements and the meaning therein).<br>

It's planar because planar infinitesimally. 3D sprinkler (two brain regions?) painter paints two values at same time (or just successively?). Could that be left and right thalami and left and right PHZ? If so, left is CMW (FILLER: include colors of SPW here!) and right is SPW (minus color).<br>

I bet little twitches like leg jumping to right may be the rings incidentally getting close to leg and hence it appears to motor cortex as a command to get over, and subsequently jerks over. Could dangerous spasms therefore be a malfunction of rings going too close to body too frequently without intended instructions therealong?<br>
<br>
Sometimes when awaking from s1 or s2 sleep (starting to "doze off") and opening eyes but then closing, it's like V1 (&Co) engine get going a little but not enough to be convincing in eyes closed, and you see about 6-12/heartbeat(sober, so about 7-14++ Hz) frontoparallel frames painting your eyes closed black and you see it is several scenes. And maybe just outlines but the outlines via onion skin depth/side peel can look like black and white and color. Tho it is frontoparallel, it can be painted to look like a peach or butt or whatever.<br>
Could color be done by amplitude of ring change, or velocity of thrust out of SPW 90° to its ring?<br>
Could eyes open being creating of new frames, and eyes closed is using of old frames, but eyes closed can't do color well because insufficient number of frames or because color requires novelty?<br>
Afterimage may still be coming in at 40 Hz just not a lot of neurons.<br>
Color repped by spatial frequency of lines, but that frequency is repping(meaning) "over time duration"? Or by orientation (doubt it) and spatial freq is for amplitude (doubt it).<br>
Maybe retina+lgn+v1+experience -> neat starting point info -> hipp (CA1) (or PPA Parahippocampal place area) creates meaningless, but neat Geometrical 3D bank of outlines. DG is 3D reenactment of current SPW OR CMW, which then CA3 takes a 2D slice as a tool.<br>

Driving around curve, shearing off of imagination of dude from SPW Physical world dude <br>
maybe brain uses contour map and each ring represents 1 foot of depth but then what is color?<br>
<br>
The ring, ethereal, is kind of like the triangle that has no lines but is seen in forefront and as existing none the less due to cut of other. Like CMW cuts out the cavern out of CMW 3D via the ring and cave wall bumps are inertial and CMW written "on cave walls."<br>
SPW feels entire, with puzzle piece slices and perhaps world written on that on all sides???<br>
<br>
<br>
It paints it on the cylinder fabric better than a movie screen, and size that objects are drawn can give them depth behind the fabric. Apparently viewing angle can be painted on (this translated image-star-cluster idea, i.e. that a 2D sphere shell image actually exists at a point as a "star cluster" at your pupil prior to inversion and landing on retina).<br>
<br>
If it is a part of the universal consciousness that story can be understood, then animals have the same thing.<br>
<br>
Maybe the "attitude baked in" to paint just means that SPW includes your body or at least retina and from retina out thru air. <br>
<br>
Maybe there is but one ring (with paster and futurer) and one cylinder, and both SPW and CMW build their 3D worlds by painting on same cave wall (??).<br>
<br>
So like cerebellum has the time precision to wiggle lines at rate needed for high freq sound. And like inhibited Purkinje cells could be suppressing the writing of CMW either along ring or within. Writing by inhibition of SPW? And the inhibition travels back to cerebrum in form of not exciting a region. But how is shape conveyed?<br>
FILLER: Here's a thot!! Could cerebellum be doing rings and CMW with PFC, and PHZ does SPW with PFC, and then the very few return paths from the cerebellum to the cerebrum are saying WHERE the cursor currently is within SPW????? Or, God forbid, cerebellum is painting the SPW ("WHERE") and the cerebrum does the CMW (since langauge and left hemisphere and all that).<br>
<br>
And like cerebrum has the processing power to flick full frames at 40-80 Hz thereby creating the etheric feeling visual frontoparallel screen (can still be painted on cylinder inside) and thereby creating black and white and color and translucency.<br>
<br>
Benham's disk they say is blue yellow opponency. Creates vague purple, vague blue (dark and light), vague green, vague yellow tan, vague pink tan. Light purple, light dull green, light tan. (CCW spin-) Middle out purple tan olive green deep green. Reversing spin (to CW) direction reverses order of colors.<br>
<br>
I think cerebellum draws rings - paster, present, and futurer for duration of about 1 second. Maybe mossy fibers from granule cells are CMW spatial info and climbing fibers tells cerebrum (SPW) which plane to use for continuing to draw CMW. <br>
<br>
Does PFC do autopilot stuff or math for CMW or both or neither? Supposedly it has lots of filters and "morals." Maybe will arises there with or without the other stuff. FILLER: Apparently math is often done in same area as language and close to auditory cortex.<br>
<br>
Or could PCs be drawing color and other stuff needing all those extra senses of 90°? Doubt it as color still present without cerebellum.<br>
<br>
Yellow, green, then red at bottom (before red at top, yellow middle, blue bottom). Red, white, green Italian flag at 0 delay frames. Red, green, purple @ 1 delay frame. As you thicken the slices, instead of white getting colored, black gets colored in same way. V thick, green yellow purple, faster purple white green.<br>
<br>
You often don't see people's goals cause they can be hidden in pfc and not even shown in story or in body language.<br>
<br>
If SPW laid frames down in 6 directions hexagon points all in frontoparallel plane, it would provide a good sense of roll (and pitch) of head by comparing that to AGU of physical universe. Maybe that is 8++ Hz at slowest. Or is this just a memory search phenomenon?<br>
<br>
It's almost like there's groups of neurons with each group dedicated to a ring and to changing the position of dudes legs say even as it passes more and more past up to 0.5 seconds and the fading out. Note that this ring-a-round movement is movement of characters within story - it isn't used to paint (gosh I bet a ton of PFC is dedicated to knowing and remembering how to swipe words without even thinking) it isn't used to paint sound vibrations I don't think. Sound vibrations seem to be done with vibrating radially inwards/outwards (or futurer/paster, less likely) the CURRENT RING ITSELF. High pitch seems to have high spatial frequency of rings ie bunching up of rings into a pinch off but it makes for very smooth cave ceiling with little variation. Maybe rings get bunched together on a part of ring to rep high freq sound so as to have more rings to work with "temporally(/spatial freq)," even tho it is using a spatial dimension to bunch these rings together, but they're bunched there for a short duration and then go back, but while they are bunched there, they're available for use during the entire high note! Ie they can be vibrated as quickly as desired and for the entire high note you have like 8 rings instead of 3 or 4 and at high density to allow for very fine tuned drawing on cave wall/ceiling both up and sideways variations and inbetween (both are examples of radially inward/outward options).<br>
Maybe sound frequency is being drawn in this manner with tinier spatial distance between nodes corresponding to tinier (higher freq) wavelengths!!!!! <br>
Is ring always horizontal to CMW?? <br>
As soon as I hear rain, I "know" what it is cause CMW, tho ring is vibrating to rep sound, it is drawing rain drops and lightning bolts and SPW is throwing in a thunder frame maybe with word and CMW has jaw moving word rain. CMW draws the "what" of everything that comes upon your "now." Maybe CMW top level is the section of brain that does "what"- the "what pathway"!! And SPW is the "where pathway"!!! If correct, then SPW actually is outlines/locations/physical space/skin only (maybe?) and color is handled by CMW?!<br>
If color is repped "spatially" by bunching of rings, by necessity it must be a very high freq (low wavelength) so as to be spatially smooth in high resolution seemingly in SPW. Note sound may not be a radially inward/outward vibration of ring, but rather the rings may be NODES with vibration somehow else repped by amplitude linked to at each point so that cave ceiling vibrates.<br>
CMW can have coronal and sagittal planes cause remember dua lipa i had coronal ring and she was facing me so she had coronal ring and our AGUs were aligned. Yes the ring plane is always the same (shared).<br>
SPW seems to thicken into wedge puzzle piece at "now" then sink downwards and shrink. Like it's the part of SPW captured by ring interior, and cave outwards is the part of CMW captured by ring exterior; and former like those calculus block approximations to curve, but in 3D!!<br>
SPW puzzle is viewed from outside in, but one attitudinal vantage point (or say puzzle is oriented a certain way meant to be viewed from that way); CMW is viewed from mind's eye being inside cave looking out towards cave wall but again you can see depth "etheric" and again there's a certain vantage attitude. So again you have normal eye and mind's eye.<br>
It's wacky how ring-sun is mostly independent of body rotation (try turning your back on coronal projected-out rings while high! But that may be too much) and small body movement, but moves with car and stays glued to you as car goes around curve (it twists attitude to stay same angle to you)!!<br>
Is it really possible tho to focus on both CMW and SPW at same time so as to see cave AND puzzle pieces? I haven't seen it. Of course you can focus on corresponding focus point between the two worlds, as with left knee jerk to right.<br>
It's like SPW paints body outline, then (if you're looking at body) CMW comes from back or from interior and eats out all of it right to skin intersection with physical world (the 3d of each).<br>
SPW has an AGU1; CMW has an AGU2; ROF has a direction of flow (DOF). All three can vary. <br>
Does the cerebellum inhibit itself or inhibit the part of PHZ such that only the qualia comes thru, not the 3d cartoon? And hemp, suppressing the neurons exciting the inhibitory PCs, means "ima excite you so you do show the 3d cartoon work behind the qualia - might be a bit disorientating!"<br>
By every instant having a 0.5 second "past" and 0.5 second "future," then incoming stimuli can be bound into one sensible time flow cartoon!! Slightly lagging stimuli get written into slightly paster frames, and faster than normal stimuli can be drawn into slightly futurer frames. Adjustments can be made over time. The thing it models may be staying mostly still, which helps make brain's job a little easier. I think anticipation work already done before committing to writing this stuff on canvas cylinder.<br>
It could be that paster and futurer rings are still done in PHZ, but that cerebellum helps fine tune (or shwing down ring is that really a thing?).<br>
Does cerebellum inhibit the rings as node points to control the vibration and have it meaningful?? How does it draw spatial paster-futurer spatial dimension space?<br>
Does the cerebellum inhibit all the stuff in brain it doesn't want to be included in conscious story? Or excite in a way to balance out like noise canceling headphones.<br>
At least 5 attitude-change/movement/reference-frames - (1) attitude of SPW AGU1 (fixed), (2) attitude of CMW AGU2 (changeable), (3) attitude of ROF DOF, (4) movement of objects in SPW, (5) movement/rotation of FPP in SPW, (6) movement/turning in a car in SPW, (7) movement/rotation of FPP of a character in CMW, (8) rotation (yaw, etc.) of CMW by will, (9) attitude change of mind's eye pitching up or down, (10) translation of CMW.<br>

<br>
Just cause you know AGU of CMW doesn't mean you know where the plane attaches or where on plane the ring is, or even that plane of ring is same attitude as AGU2.<br>
<br>
AGU is kinda like a mic stand with planar base and shaft coming up, but for SPW it's also glued in place so it can't spin. I guess for CMW too (of course this one can attitudinally rock).<br>

<br>Could also say there's an x,y,z ref frame for SPW (always totally fixed) and a set for CMW (stays fixed glued to CMW but rocks attitudinally relative to SPW), with AGU being zed in both cases; there's also an x,y,z ref frame for ROF (x,y important though where to define them starting seems arbitrary and unimportant)(futurer rings are the zed here I guess and then DOF would be negative zed)(also, are rings being drawn either CW or CCW tho you have to define "when looking from high on positive zed axis down onto plane").
<br>
Getting in a car is a tool to move you around world. The earth still is fixed even if you are moved around thus by another. ROF stays fixed to universe if you move/rotate (small distance), but is fixed to you if you are brought around a curve or driven forward. If puzzle pieces laid down while being driven, they appear to stack right on top of each other, cause it holds you/car as being stationary, and the world as moving in response to your tires.<br>
<br>
We know the purpose of SPW and CMW; what is the purpose of the rings? I think their inertial vibration creates all felt qualia; also, it seems that rings often are things focused on (though I have focused on phone screen instead of ring but it's like that requires a higher frequency [you have to force yourself to NOT stop and smell the roses and ignore the natural and use extra resolve and putin seriousness to focus] to want to look at the painted content over the stuff brain said was worthy of natural focus). Also, rings seem to instruct the means of conscious, willed motor movements in general painted description. They draw and or use shapes to or from memory. They use shapes to convey meaning and it seems that they even paint or reveal the 3d essence of the CMW.<br>
<br>
Ah!! Now you KNOW that ring's plane is NOT the bisection b/w horizontal planes of SPW and CMW!! Cause Lionel Richie. FILLER: Wait, what? I think current ring could still be intersection plane.<br>
<br>
The story informs current attitude of ring because where would the content coming out of gun match on story. Such that ring attitude is set by story+gunContent. <br>
FILLER: Could ring attitude be set often by direction opposite your movement, like when you are walking your body somewhere, not when you are being driven?<br>
<br>
It's almost like ring attitude is only thing that matters.<br>
<br>
Is it like there's a set of plans (rings) for color+space, for sound, for temperature, for smell, etc? Like there is electrical, hvac, framing, roofing plans?<br>
FILLER: This is an interesting idea as the flow from each could be a different speed and direction and using that and cyclic precession with time precision of cerebellum could "paint" multiple things at once.<br>
<br>
If mamu has presents I mean paint. FILLER: WTH? Lol.<br>

Maybe even spatial and color are drawn by 2d rings. Ie by 1d gun. With rings meaning spatial memory and what not.<br>

CMW looks like an astronaut attitude-rotating in space or space station.<br>

If you can have qualia of motion (or spin! or deeperify) in a static image (illusion), does that mean motion and spin and deepify are qualia (vibrations) imposed over SPW?<br>

Could be consciousnesses arise as a way to reduce random noise (a story to explain). Maybe universe does too, but then is it even necessary if former is true?<br>
<br>
You've discovered the underliers of consciousness and a description of many of the details of that. But you have not discovered the NCC not the exact neural mechanism of consciousness. That (and better details of former) is what you are getting closer to gaining as you keep going back.<br>

Why does hemp make you colder? Is it the increase in visibility (and effect?) of CMW/rings? FILLER: It's called THC-induced hypothermia!<br>
<br>
Maybe cerebellum PC "nos" is what gives us will. And brain learns to run things your way usually it only needs input here and there.<br>
<br>
So, sound isn't written along ring as if it were unraveled because where on ring each time around matters. FILLER: Well sound, even perceptually, by definition requires quite a bit higher frequency than these 10 Hz rings. More like 20-2,000+ Hz, which can be done by vibrating the whole ring shape which in independent (I guess) from ring cursor location. Then it can spatially segregate sounds to their source in CMW.<br>
<br>
Cold is a cartoon+inertia -> the qualia of cold is you've grouped all cold triggering events together. But the main thing is cold has meaning as cold because the story cartoon dude in the cartoon he is getting cold and cold exists as either a linked association of memories or just on its own as a universal property it exists in metaphysical world. It seems you can remember stuff because if it was in story before then you can remember it - it's just jogging the memory (plus being relaxed - not overly inhibited by your past being shot down) that is required. If memory really is an etheric thing (exists because it was once drawn), then maybe those who lose hipp are actually losing the ability to draw rings (and therefore jog memory) or else maybe the ability to create certain-geometric shape rings for future memory purpose and to compare to some other past ring in order to flush out where else in cerebrum needed to fill out.<br>
<br>
When you remember the past, you are making a CMW 3d (IMAGINATION) depiction of that SPW at that specific time, but I guess also contained is the ring, as well as the qualia conveyed by cartoon outline at that specific time. Meanwhile, your focus on CURRENT SPW and CMW are suppressed. When you imaginate, SPW is dulled while CMW is more active.<br>
<br>
I pitch down to remember s w i toppers (headboard wall coronal and in front of me sitting in car; bathroom to car right); I pitch backwards to remember s w i bottoms (headboard wall coronal and behind me sitting in car; bathroom to car left; so 180° effective yaw spin; but instead of spinning the room, it just kinda fades out from one scenario then enters another scenario or so it seems).<br>
<br>
Porch memory always seems at 10:00, AGU2 fixed (in parallelity) to AGU1.<br>
<br>
I doubt you have to get an attitude match of ring to trigger memory, but rather only a shape match (story match needed?). Maybe you don't need a shape match at all but rather a similarity in meaning or id tag, and hipp or whatever can make necessary ring shape cut thereoutfrom that frame.<br>
<br>
It's almost like CMW is drawn with somewhat random frames (thickened frames, as if the stored puzzle pieces of past SPW!), out of which(/upon which) rings are drawn. Then is SPW created with CMW rings which are thickened to puzzle pieces?? Like the inertial change of current CMW ring (sound energy etc) drives the attitude and shape change of ring and SPW models it's thickened slice puzzle piece model of world? But movement of eye changes focus but not necessarily the ring but how does a slice draw all the stuff you're focusing on outside its boundaries??<br>
<br>
Or, does CMW somehow encode(create) spatial and movement data of SPW?<br>
<br>
The weird thing is that at your highest, it appeared brain was 3d sprinkler painting both worlds at once with 1D data. Here's a thot - whatever you focus on attentively (incidentally let's say visually also), your imagination is drawing rep of that. It could also be that when you are high, you are more relaxed and not WANTING to look around at a lots of points, but when sober, since you are moving eyes around a lot, your ring attitude is varying DRAMATICALLY. <br>
<br>
Or! Could it be that that thing you saw of world getting handled by spider so quickly REALLY WAS how SPW is drawn, and the very high frame rate is why you don't normally see it?!! Yes i think you just solved it! Then color is either that super fast vibration of eyes (faster than saccades) or else vibration of higher freq rings associated with VC.<br>
<br>
So then the stored rings don't need to be Geometrical in layout but rather a sequence of amplitude over time, possibly with a code at beginning to say rate of going around. Also, absolute attitude needn't matter, but only change in attitude. But perhaps it does align it via semi-circular canals. Well it is aligned in sense that the SPW it draws always stays PUAGU (physical universe anti gravity up)! Which then needn't have any correlation to physical universe, being an abstract movie (?).<br>
<br>
Finally, where exactly are these rings drawn, and how is 2d ring spatiality represented? And ethereal cursor of ring is what mechanism (action potential? dendritic potential?)?<br>

What if the math tables are only learnable by someone first showing you? So that you get memories of the teacher saying 7x9=63 and memories of seeing the writing 7x9=63 and drawing 7x9=63 and means of checking closeness "7x10=70 just move the zero over." If so, beginnation of schools was critical in "evolution" of humans to becoming more productive logical advanced people.<br>
<br>
legal hemp allows the use of certain (childhood good memory) geometric rings that ADULT or RELIGIOUS or HEDONISTIC sober brain usually (stupidly) forbids, which trigger memories that you sober would never have been able to trigger. I think it is the specific geometric shape that triggers the memory, and HIPP can then make or take a few other close certain-geo-shape-rings along that progression from that 3d movie and be changing attitude thereby incidentally which tends to draw out (somewhat) the 3d sense of that memory.<br>
<br>
Cursor needs to draw- ether, black/white, color, translucency (multiple depth given by meaning ie by what is drawn- you wouldn't know depth of three translucent objects without 3d attitude sampling and/or depth clues meaning), meant distance (done by what is drawn), meant perspective (done by what is drawn). It would seem that black is default given by not doing anything or by the creation of space, and white is pure tone?<br>

Throw of inertial in car topping hill repped by this motion of rings:<br>
<br>
Into phone screen coronal then fall forward to horizontal and down some on bank for awhile like those nasa car rides - but it's like the otolith is repping where on cube to pick rings and there's a "centered" and kicking (futurer) forward reps a "jump" in time like car starting at green light. But remember toe/foot stretch curl in back was spatial 3d over time (different). Car cresting hill is like too high ie z in bank getting thrown to the too future ie x, spatial for y allows for rings in any attitude.<br>
<br>
Filler: Bank selection draws acceleration as movement to future. <br>
<br>
Seemed to be two banks - one glued to head and head size - and one imagination and floating.<br>
<br>
No doubt accelerations are drawn by this throwing from centered and slowly imperceptibly recovering that back altho perhaps not entirely newtonionly accurate if you continue to accelerate? Or maybe oooith gets that.<br>
<br>
Maybe layers 2,3 hold pyramidal treasure of bank static to head (for ring selection) and layer 5 (or vice versa) views same pyramidal bank as floating with imagination world (but you usually rock whole CMW not just the object like Hawkins said. Maybe some of the neurons that aren't known of BANK NEURONS are truly spatial but used as ring shape only which also has to be converted. It world give you not really a perfect sphere, and no cube so how is that done? Static bank Box ALMOST felt like corners protruded air. Plus you have phantom pain so I don't think that the spatial location of the neuron can matter, but who knows.<br>

What is rate of ring reading of bank or mult? What is rate of bank? Is there a rate of bank? Does ascending activating RF thru non-spec hit the bank? Or does it hit ring neurons or neither?<br>
<br>
Neuron reps a location within bank. As such, can use bank to measure against itself versa a transform that needs to be say twice or half as large or rotated or rotating etc. Can still draw toe in a more linear fashion by selection of 3d outline repping neurons within bank changing over time.<br>

But is there no scaffolding to give size to bank? That seems to be a pretty fundamental question.<br>

What are your discoveries so far?<br>
(1) That there is a ring solving binding.<br>
(2) That the brain creates a 3D imagination CMW in addition to the 3D visual SPW.<br>
(3) That vibrations/progressions of ring(s) produce qualia.<br>
(4) That audio components of a rock song can be segregated and repped in diff locations on ring.<br>
(5) That level of CMW amplitude can possibly make you percept colder etc.<br>
(6) That brain can filter by anything (anything can be a memory trigger). You store the trigger with the memory in order to "store the memory." The memory would be "stored" anyhow, but you'd never recall it if hippocampus didn't embed all the possible commonality triggers you'd like along with it.<br>
(7) That there is a bank or banks used in a multitide of ways, possibly part of hipp or cortex, storing and retrieving ring-shapes/frames.<br>
(8) That inertial throw can be repped by one rep of bank with rings thrown off center in direction of force experienced.<br>
(9) That breathing MIGHT be repped by ebb and flow of water in bank.<br>
(10) That there is a headbank (and eyes and two eye banks?) repping "head direction."<br>
(11) That there can be a vehiclebank such as carbank. Or, most fundamental bank drawing consciousness the story is somewhat in front of you, fixed to your LOCAL ENVIRONS.<br>
(12) That there is a further-away environmentbank (or many if many cars each needing their own designation of different and changing velocities) if you're riding in a car (or walking down a road, etc.).<br>
(13) That scaling can be accomplished by comparing bank against self with multiplier.<br>
(14) That the bank which draws consciousness is, honestly, stationary by definition. Therefore, movement through the world is depicted to happen in the story movie the bank 3D prints, but its "3D screen" never moves.<br>
(15) Although the brain, which holds the neurons that are firing to somehow by meaning draw the bank/cursor/ring/consciousness, may be physically moved through the world if you take a hike; nevertheless we are as blind to knowing movement as we are to knowing the physical universe. Therefore we do not perceive this movement and the "screen" feels stationary to the trained observer. Only WITHIN THE STORY is the movement, detected by vestibular organ, given conscious awareness.<br>
(16) That therefore flow can arise as the contra-movement of paster scenes when a moving (in real life, but more importantly, within story) "you" (rather, the bank right in front of you) are considered stationary. Flow can arise without movement too, probably for the left brain's use in contemplating past vs. present (vs. future?).<br>
<br>
If there were a left eye bank, right eye bank, and combined eye bank, it seems they would have to be retina, lgn, and V1. If so, then maybe head bank would be in cerebrum (or parahippocampal gyrus) (input from vestibular) with scaling up mechanism for cube. If so, your-circle-of-world bank could be PHZ. If so, car bank could be nearby possibly as inertia bank or with help from inertia bank obviously with tie-ins from vestibular. If so, imagination(/memory?) bank could be cerebellum and/or hipp.<br>

<br>
Is a frame done via a single neuron? Like there's a jennifer Aniston neuron. And that would seem to be a frame if not a ring.<br>
<br>
Dunno that rate at any instant even really matters except incidentally in how much detail could be drawn like color prolly can't except at high rate. Timing and precision in time difference to draw in high def obviously does. And attitude and shape must be known.<br>
<br>
Do you celebrate the discovery that "you" don't exist? Kinda same thing, but still kinda neat.<br>

The ring feels like the marriage of the two worlds (SPW, CMW). But remember CMW flows thru current time all the time in a spatially linear manner repping a sense of time flow.<br>
<br>
Could (enlarged?) precuneus (addition of imagination CMW) be what sets man apart from beast? It could be what enables complex language via segregation of sounds, and the what if thinking that enables man to overcome many obstacles which animals cannot (cat unable to figure how to turn water on/understand need to turn off when done).<br>

Maybe cerebellum really is fine tune motor and thinking control, but via language of rings/2D frames/3d-cartoon-reduced-to-2d-at-any-given-moment. If so, could it also contribute future and past rings? If it does contribute future, do the predicted ring shapes go to cerebrum for it to plan how to rotate and attach stuff and create upcoming current ring?<br>
<br>
Could cerebellum be memory? Like cerebrum learns what ring associated with the firing of a certain PC?<br>

What is the flow of the CMW and/or rings? Just describe it precisely. It obviously is a spatial kick while happening over time.<br>

3D+T SPW with AGU1 vector (and spin locked)(also has eye direction, head direction vectors, attention eye vector); 3D+T CMW with AGU2 vector (and spin "locked") floats around; vibratory ring that exists in a 2D plane at some attitude relative to SPW and sidedness of ring sometimes doesn't matter (like not always a preference for one side more than other cause mind's eye can even be "inside" the ring looking out).<br>
<br>
You have higher precision/detail of SPW with eyes open, but you still have sense of it somewhat with eyes closed! Altho w/o color usu. Could call it "Sensed Physical World." The CMW is more of an Imagination Focus World or "Conjured Mind World" or "Conjured Mental World." I don't think CMW is always engaging in prepping motor activity, tho it can. It's prepping and handling whatever your focus is. Focal Imagination World? Muse? "Current Mental-Image World" - that's a good one! Current Mind World, or Musing. Or just "Mental-Picture World." Then other one could be "Sensed Physical World."<br>

There's Euler axis and angle which isn't exactly like AGU2 & specific "lock" of where it is spun to, but you could take from that the fact that vector length reps spin location, only zero spin direction would mean you couldn't tell 180° flip from the vector since it would have no visibility to show preference for 180° vs -180° (opposite directions from what we're talking about. Well, just do 1-360°. 360 = 1. Silly.<br>

Kinda interesting pic. Says animals is lower; humans have connectivity b/w fronto-parietal and fronto-temporal aspects within "default mode network."<br>
<br>
Trying to draw an animal or human on paper as a slow process looks like crap and you'd think brain just lacks ability. In fact, in real time the brain draws very accurate 3D imaginations, and if you can trust yourself the split moment you think of something, you may be surprised how good you draw it. But the brain quickly moves on to thinking of other things and you lose your ability. If you think you suck at drawing then you won't trust the first moment and will lose even that will truly suck at drawing.<br>
<br>
The dude that can draw new York may have better ability to hold imagination steady so as to draw it (and may still have improved visual memory).<br>
<br>
Your imagination brain can and does draw really really well all the time, just it's so fast and so nearly subconscious that you don't notice the beauty and clarity of it.<br>
<br>
Could selected neurons (to fire APs) be the ring, and dendrite stuff whether part of firing or non-firing neurons is the 3d stuff, and vibrations to axon from other, faster firing neurons is the shake of the rings to produce sounds and colors? Or could physical sound itself induce enough superposition (may not be the word) in traveling APs to make the vibratory ring thing? But I think not cause only when you focus on heartbeat does it vibrate ring.<br>
<br>
Even the puzzle pieces of eyes open existence were getting kicked away downwards (and smaller in scale) (future was coming from above and growing in scale) (present was largest scale).<br>
<br>
So we've seen something getting kicked out from our belly, from our butt, and towards the earth. Also, I think when rings slung over and down on Susan cresting hill, the past was going up and slightly back. I've seen it kicked slightly to side but not noticing a firm left or right kick.<br>
<br>
I guess it is the RINGS (and cavernWalls/puzzlePieces) that get kicked out (and which in-come), and these rings seem to be the surface on which consciousness-holograms is drawn. I suppose the SHAPE of any given ring stays constant in going from "future" to "present" to "past," and only SCALE and ATTITUDE change (altho perhaps OUTWARDS-FROM-RING-CENTER-LOCATION and shape changes - I just know on first trip right after I drew future ring same shape when it came into present slot).<br>
<br>
Maybe your first trip you were particularly dissociated leading to paying all attention to the 2 Hz final draw of PMC. Maybe time gaps leads to consciousness drawing a box around the puzzle piece ring thus creating a sense of puzzle pieces.<br>
<br>
How did it draw phone screen text when ring coronal? Maybe flat plane drawn? Or rotate world like spider.<br>
<br>
Time flows from future to past. That is to say, future becomes present, then present becomes past. "You" are going into the future, but the future is coming closer to you then meets you at present then rushes past to become more and more distant past. If you view time from vantage point of you being stationary in time, then the future is running towards you (at light speed?). If you view time from vantage point of time (history) being a static, stationary thing, then you are racing into the future (at near light speed?). But the MIND paints YOU as STATIONARY, both in terms of spatial and temporal movement.<br>
<br>
The SPW is almost observed as a traveler passing thru a set history at a particular rate thru time with history the ref frame. So is CMW. But the rings sets you (observer of rings) as standing still and time flows thru from future becoming present then becoming past. Could this be the "two sides" of whether you have will or not? And rings uses spatial movement over actual time to represent "flow" of time as moving like an object in motion.<br>
<br>
Rings of Fire: The Secret of Brain Consciousness <br>
<br>
SPW -> Can consider surroundings fixed when being driven or can consider yourself fixed. There's a bit of allocentric freedom to consider world fixed, but it seems that it's mostly egocentric view.<br>
CMW -> I think definitely egocentric. Self stationary altho it can move mind's eye around in location and orientation.<br>
Both are observing "history" at a certain rate, right on the edge of creation of it seemingly. In both, the self (eye/observer) is moving thru time at apparently same rate as history/world. But with the rings, self is definitely stationary in time (that's what it's trying to illustrate at least), and future rushes in and past and turns into past. With rings, future is like a wave that comes in and past and you endure it. Like no will. With SPW & CMW, you seem to have total will and are creating your future as you want it with the fact that there's lots of competition for certain amount of resources, making it very difficult to find a good mate, good income, etc.<br>
<br>
You have seen the screen (light/picture) of phone coming towards you - why? How? That isn't ring.<br>
<br>
Maybe what you saw first time was corkscrew final draw of attention. And "higher freq" to pay attention to opening eyes visual field light is b/c segregated off and harder to pay attention to.<br>
<br>
Critical areas in brain for consciousness (we think)- brain stem/RF, (cerebellum [my question; scientists don't think so]?), PHZ, (amygdala [my question; scientists don't think so]?), <br>
<br>
If layer 1 of cortex has no purpose, why does it have a frigg-ton of cb1 receptors?<br>
<br>
Need to memorize Brodmann areas. Interesting that article says CMW is Brodmann 9-11 ie prefrontal cortex (counterpart to 17-19 ie visual cortex); then rings maybe at center ie bridge b/w sensory and motor cortex and also incorporate sound cortex and smells. If so what does VC do that PFC doesn't to generate color?<br>
<br>
Aphantasia and hyperphantasia. Hyper has smaller VC and larger PFC. Or just artificially suppress VC you get more visual imagination. Like phantasia ie fantasia the movie! Also, hyper means hyper of all five senses (more like 10+) not just visual tho that is easy to pinpoint and analyze.<br>
<br>
Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire by David Marks. Hard to find.<br>
<br>
If PFC (motor) handles CMW and PHZ (sensory) handles SPW, what handles the RINGS?? Would pyramidal neurons or layer 5 or layer 2,3? Input comes to layer 5, correlation happens in layers 2,3... Is layer 5 or layers 2,3 picking off the 2D ring from the 3D hologram? Or are pyramidal neurons more for building up the 3D hologram, then something else picks off 2D rings?<br>
<br>
If so, you could lose cerebellum and still have mental imagery, seeming will, and SPW. Just not the mind's eye racing around CMW nor the feeling of vibration of sound.<br>
<br>
Head direction bank is an anchor or a camera; but AGU (plus direction hex to lock down spin) seems the most fundamental ANCHOR to which SPW bank attaches. Then, rings have some attitude (what for I don't know) relative to that SPW bank. If you're in a car, the car becomes your "SPW" anchor bank (tho there is a moving SPW outside the car). Then, CMW moves around relative to either rings or SPW- I think CMW moves around relative to RINGS so as to change "view." Remember movement vs stationaryness is relative and either can be viewed as stationary. You can focus on CMW such that rings seem to go crazy with 3d movement; but if you focus on rings, they have a fairly modest amount of movement. I've never been able to imagine rings as completely stationary.<br>
So, tethering order:<br>
SPW <- RINGS <- CMW<br>
And remember that headbank, eye camera, attention camera, are all built into SPW.<br>

AUTONOMICNESS:<br>
Large part of brain; must be capable of (no! "blah blah blah"). More like any part of the brain can be included in focal consciousness if you want to, but it runs itself very much the same whether or not "you" focus and provide extra willic input. Only thing is autonomic it may not "pay as much attention" to a red light but it does "pay attention" to a parked car at a red light altho maybe a tad late for comfort. Ie respond safely to. Ie it helps to "stay present" (stay interested in the driving) as much as possible while driving.<br>
<br>
Motor muscle activation included under both.<br>
<br>
The WHOLE BRAIN (those aspects currently focused on [consciousness] and those aspects not currently focused on [autonomicness]) seems to use the RING as its means of binding and reference; hence, the RING is the ultimate anchor. Tho representationally, via meaning, SPW (SSS) is made the anchor. Perhaps amygdala (and/or hipp, PFC) handle telling the SHAPE of the ring, sensory cortex/SPW via meaning-and-AGU paints the ATTITUDE of the ring (by what spots in its matrix [what sub population of neurons within total population; or which neurons fire vs only have dendritic reverbs; or which neurons precess/lag local rate] the ring is connected to), and then meaning painted via motor cortex/CMW (by what spots in its matrix the ring is connected to) defines the final attitude of the CMW relative to the SPW!!!!! 😃😀<br>
<br>
Precessing by a little could be future, precessing by exactly half could be current (canceling out a little of neural firing is a very etheric seeming thing; quite copacetic!), precessing by a lot could be past. OR, the main thrust is ring, precession is future and lagging is past. It could rep a greater degree of past than the physical lagging provides by what is painted; hence the ability to change mistakes and it still feel real time.<br>
<br>
Then anything that fires need only pay attention to signals from amyg/hipp about RING SHAPE, signals from sensory cortex about RING ATTITUDE, signals from motor cortex about CMW ATTITUDE/STORY, and it does the necessary math LOCALLY to ensure that whatever it is going to contribute will make sense being printed on ring at any given moment!! And again, it prints on ring possibly by precessing (or cyclic max) and reps relational and autonomic stuff by the inverse. Any part of brain can have its own rate of contributing rings as its malleable frequency, then that part must do math incorporating its specific LOCAL, CURRENT rate to know how to draw. Alternatively, precession could be painting 0-2π along the ring. In fact I think it would HAVE to be painting that for the whole LOCAL, CURRENT rate stuff.<br>
<br>
If this is so, then nearly all the "hard work" of binding is done IN ADVANCE so that all that must be done is TEMPORALLY TUNED FIRING OF EXACTLY CORRECT NEURONS. This also binds disparate frequencies! Binds left and right hemispheres (math work must be done before). Binds front and back halves (rings serve as connection point b/w 3D SPW and 3D CMW). Binds segregated audio together (different spots on ring). Binds multi-sensory info together (smell, cold, pain, aspirations, ideas, sound, color all can be "painted" in 3D SPW or 3D CMW or more importantly on ring thus binding disparate senses together in one focus). Provides a nice rubric for conscious vs autonomic transitions altho one can focus on minutia deep within say the SPW. Binds input vs output (at least provides a nice rubric for it). Binds cerebrum and cerebellum as they both must obey law of the ring (unless it is kinda left out but I doubt it). Provides for sense of self without contamination from nearby brains. Provides for splitting of brain into sorta "two consciousnesses" when corpus callosum cut and PFC becomes two PFCs (one ring, two very similar SPWs that prolly merge, and two very different CMWs). Provides for RF being critical for origination signal, provides for PHZ to be "seat of consciousness" if that is where (rings? and CMW? [but it isn't] and) SPW is drawn, altho it would not explain why percepts of cold etc except that maybe rings could be drawn there. Maybe CMW is not something you are usually cognizant of, though it informs your whole story. Or, maybe PFC puts story together, but PHZ actually draws it. Well that's a bummer. Could it be that triggering PHZ neurons triggers ring which triggers PFC? I would think so. So maybe I saved it! Or could PHZ (or hipp/amyg) be drawing the rings, and a slightly posterior region draws 3D SPW? No you just said rings are drawn by the selection of which neurons within the scaffolding of 3D SPW. It could be that cerebellum provides painting upon future and past rings (which could still come from amyg/hipp bank). I dunno. I kinda think amyg needs to stay just for emo and let PFC or just neocortex in general store shapes of rings.<br>
<br>
What would happen if ring shapes removed? Then it would prolly paint normal rings which would take away some of the interest of the subconscious and make things boring and monotonous? Would it take away memory association? I mean I could see amyg containing ring shapes and hipp containing frames made from rings that could then be cookie-cut with current amyg ring shape. <br><br>
<br>
Could traveling wave in hipp be providing frames with which to paint SPW as a planar thing with depth meaning? No cause ppl w/o hipp still see. Could hipp traveling wave simply be providing frames to give ideas for memories as for when you want to go down a trail? And the frames aren't used to paint with but rather to jog memory with? And "Mitchell" jogs a (or several?) frame(s) in hipp (and thus many memories in cerebrum)? And you can suppress memories from periods of your life (ahem, sandy), maybe by a real time filter or maybe partly by permanent inhibition. Maybe those with a transformative event in youth forget their early childhood as they are trying to "change" who they are. It can be an overreaction that does harm in suppressing good memories.<br>
<br>
You know it almost seems like rings have to start with VC. Think about it. Visual is all about edge detection. Shapes that form a closed boundary IN VC is how you would get a sonic-the-hedgehog ring in the first place. Sonic would form on retinas, on LGNs, and on blown up foveal areas of VCs, and merged into single map in layer above, and possibly in V2, V4, and PHZ (here possibly in repped rather than spatial geometric isotopic manner). But remember you can experience rings outside you're scope of vision just FYI altho shape could still come from here. Yes there is still some activity within VC when eyes closed. So could VC be bank of rings? Or could VC provide rings, and layer 2,3 pinwheels provides multiple orientations for them and the combo is the bank?<br>
<br>
Think about this. VC sends signals to V4 along what pathway which handles SHAPES!!! Then next step in path in entorhinal and hipp!!! Can you really focus on more than one shape at a time? Dunno.<br>
<br>
Do ppl that lose hipp lose ability to recognize shapes?<br>

<br>
But, sure would be handy if it (LOC) could pull ring shapes from hipp (or entorhinal) where they would be stored in actual geometric iso spatial manner!! Maybe LOC stores addresses for rings, and hipp or entorhinal stores actual rings (?). Or keep it simple and let LOC store actual shapes somehow and hipp is only for memory.<br>

It's almost like brain has encrypted a consciousness-rep that could have been spatial, but by using some code, it takes out the imperfections and changes to brain size that would make spatial isotopy imperfect and thereby it makes consciousness so freaking perfect in resolution and spatial accuracy. But what is this mechanism??<br>
<br>
Perhaps you could inhibit 0-360° of a single plane with dendrites of a pyramidal neuron via inhibitory synapses in layers 2,3. Do the creases in two other planes (random neurons within) serve as the means of constantly rotating the world around in 3D to look at a particular intersection with ring (if so, ring is in layer 5 or just in completely separate neurons). That doesn't really seem to compute either. It's like there's nothing ACTUALLY SPATIAL about the repping of space. Weird. Unless retinotopic but that is very wonked in scale of fovea altho I seemed to sense that wonk possibly when looking at sulfur high. Could the wonk in scale be used as mechanism for scaling up and down? And even for octaves?<br>
<br>
Or perhaps certain neurotransmitters are used to paint ring vs hologram; or perhaps inhibitory are used to paint hologram and excitatory are used to paint ring (?).<br>
<br>
Could release of neurotransmitters from vescicles be real source of consciousness?<br>

Could devil-tone (freak) (octave divided by two) vs octave be similar to sq rt of 10 (3.333) vs sq rt of 100 (10)?<br>

The you is a prefect straight line. You tried on different things - sbc role, jae role. The same you tho. And it was looking at a left-offset sagittal ring (standing at right looking to left). Where there is explicity (opposite is ambiguity) in action, you have no cover. <br>

What if the mechanisms that physically change your net eye/head direction also "encode" the "3D attitude rotation" of CMW and SPW (or rings)? Good idea!! Could globus pallidus internal then inhibit those signals from actually being physically carried out? Could globus pallidus internal also inhibit body from moving during REM? Dunno. Because folks with epilepsy have damage to mesial (middle) temporal lobe, or to no region at all - didn't find that GPI is damaged in such cases. But neurons could still rep rotation of CMW in an otherwise "vaccinated" copy of motor/head movements.<br>
<br>
I make such rotations to a different space for lowerGa vs upperGa memories - lowerGa is head on while I lay here in upstairs bed- upperGa seems to be rotated about 90° counter clockwise looking from below upwards. <br>

SPW closes out some when you close your eyes; when you sleep and dream you completely forget it's there and CMW becomes "reality." Pretty cool. Unless awake is the stable dream within the spirit world, and some trigger within dream takes you thru the portal.<br>
<br>
Could globus pallidus internal determine "reality" by letting or not letting cortico-cortical signals go thru?<br>
<br>
Tent zipper interpreted as creepy pasta sound- as you are "drifting off" you are interpreting sounds more in accord with mood and more and more DETACHED from "real world"- awake there is sudden identification of the literal meaning of zipper as attached to "real world."<br>

The lack of color doesn't result in black and white; rather it results in outlines. Black and white are colors; hence color is a 3 dimensional space! Hmm that should have been obvious. The only thing is black could be nothing as the outlines seem to be in outer space ie black backdrop. The outlines seem etheric rather than white or seeable. Almost like color is planar for traditional colors but only positive in zed axis for white (luminosity?); and there can be no negative. Or like it is a cone or spire or rather spindle and if you excite a moderate bit you can go outwards and have colors; but if you excite nearly none or nearly max (is there a max?) you get essentially black or essentially white.<br>
<br>
If matter isn't completely permanent, then it is ephemeral like mind. As such it has no real existence. Hence that theory that only change exists, but it too will pass. The changes of change are on a third tier. Is there an infinite tier on which God rests and doesn't rest, as the unchanging but seemingly unexisting?<br>
<br>
The reason dreams are more potent in mood (including scariness of nightmare; or shivering cold) is because imagination world becomes more vivid (you're paying more attention to it) as physical world fades. Same as hemp.<br>
<br>
legal hemp allows a man to see where women are coming from, blue lotus (or a thc blocker [maybe such as cbd]) may allow a woman to see where men are coming from. Blue lotus tho doesn't increase the psyche-injurer whereas a mild cb1-antagonist would presumably. Of course, cb1-antagonists (anti-hemps) are actually dangerous and could be lethal.<br>
<br>
There seems to be a feed for happiness, drive, etc., that is fed in either into story/rings or whatever - it seems to be felt separate from story or at least fed separate from story. Like there is a region which when firing increases happy - maybe the nucleus accumbens/dopamine? But maybe not as that is more for "better than expected so learn." Thc makes happy. Coke would prolly make things feel "better than expected" (feel good). Serotonin makes you have more reservoir/drive. Opioids make you feel pain-removed and dreamy.<br>

Try free fall (or S___ driving cresting hill on interstate) listening to music loud while high. Are artists' feet upside down? Cause past should be going up. Or does it simply throw starting from feet rather than starting from head?<br>
<br>
For a sec I was wondering if CMW is the audio (cortex) only, but you can imagine (either actively or suggestively from brain) say toe curl or drinking or whatever.<br>
<br>
So I think you can focus on (mentally look at) CMW 3D skins as you can pay attention to text within SPW tho it is not "natural" ring focus.<br>
<br>

Let's imagine you're curling a dumbbell weight. That arm you see doesn't exist (there is an arm in the physical world, but it isn't the one you're looking at - for one, the arm in the physical world is colorless). The feel of the weight in your fingers also doesn't exist physically. Nor does the feeling of increasing retraction of muscles as you curl the weight upwards. Neither does the (perceived) room in which you're exercising exist physically. All of this (perceptual) stuff is inside your brain and is solely its creation.<br>
<br>
I'm feeling pretty good, content, satisfied. The resignation and letting go of judging self feels good. It's within the story (that almost sphere looking thing).<br>
<br>
Wrong answers can’t be stored as inhibition – long-term inhibition — they have to be stored as excitatory but qualified excitatory in other words it’s held there but it's held as the wrong answer. "Like pupets on a string" selena gomez ring literally on. So the mental image video clip is saved but somewhere else saves that image is not what she is saying and then you can create that the real image needs to be puppets dangling on strings. The third time you can actually let your imagination have some freedom and it draws Grateful Dead puppets dancing on a string loop and yet you know that’s not what she means and you also don’t care. You don’t get confused.<br>
<br>
how do you convert mass to energy?<br>
<br>
Electric waves = light = charge = continual outflow at light speed which drives movement (relative to subject's movement). Does an entire medium stay fixed to every point of matter? An ether for every particle or for every reference motion speed/direction? Light speed has no relation to speed of emitter (tho spectral shift does happen), but only to receiver. <br>
Or is light reverse in time, so that what looks like the receiver is actually the emitter and hence why. Or is it in negative time? <br>
Inertial waves = small (sub-luminal) movement (measured by subject).<br>
And does luminal or some specific sub-luminal speed have any meaning apart from a reference motion/fixation? Not really.<br>
<br>
Brain uses (charged) ions a lot. Of course yea also neutral neurotransmitters.<br>
<br>
<br>
A "you got that wrong" is simply "get feeling bad" and "you got that right" is simply "get feeling happy!" because that's how it's stored as a child. There isn't an inherent true/false mechanism in brain; rather you store reactions (memories).<br>
<br>
Can you really have 0-2 pi with say sonic the hedgehog? Maybe same way you can have multiple crosses in 3d of translucense.<br>
<br>
Beer warms you perceptually but makes body actually colder. Hemp makes you perceptually colder (actually both).<br>
<br>
Beer dilates blood vessels so you get a reading of warmer even tho it is allowing you to lose body heat. Hemp lowers your body temperature. Shivering from hemp due to thc causing your body to stop producing heat. "THC-induced hypothermia."<br>
<br>
It's almost like there's unconscious spheric saccades turning world around, as there are eye saccades to gather info from scene. Additionally there is some way that world scene (immediate environs) are made stable to gravity and spin locked. Possibly also got CMW. <br>
<br>
How does brain hold scene stable? Blinds you (increases showtime of last stable scene and possibly shortens exposure of it) during saccade- in this way you can create short exposure freezes-of-motion of a spinning ceiling fan by jerking your eyes about in many quick large-distance saccades. You see the fan stopped in various phases of rotation as a camera could. How does brain maintain up of scene (crown of head up)? Prolly by what cones are uppermost (actually lowermost cause flipped) in retina.<br>
<br>
I think it would be at least a worthwhile exploration to consider if brain may do the same for spheric saccades (of SPW confirmed and of CMW surmised). In fact, the saccades eyes make aren't truly linear, but rather angular (spheric) even tho they are limited to about say 90 degrees (5000 square degrees?) of conic angular spheric movement.<br>
<br>
So if brain increases showtime of an angular position of SPW or CMW on ring so as to blind the brain during spheric saccade, this may make scene more stable. Altho it seemed more like a spider man-handling-3D-rotating world and maybe even locally scaling parts thereof, with the movement sampled along the way. And in this case AGU (and spin lock) of immediate environs serves as the stable thing against which to fix all the spheric saccade readings. But astronauts in space can learn to use visual input of lettering direction up (LDU) as the stabilizer in the absence of gravity and utricle/saccule(/semicircular canals?). So it uses AGU as first or I suppose brain finds it a useful benchmark/compass and hence learns in memory to use it to fix SPW.<br>
<br>
From a physics standpoint, to perform a spheric saccade you would need a launch and land axis (maybe 41,253 resolution), which would then give a spin direction (CW vs CCW), a distance ie phase angle (0-2ñ); and there'd be acceleration, max velocity, deceleration etc. But from an eye perspective, all you need is the one point to which you want to saccade (with last point always standing as the origin/reference/launch point), and the launch and land and previous point defines all the rest of that. You can't rotate a sphere about two axes simultaneously, but you can rotate about one followed by another.<br>
<br>
The fact I experienced spheric saccades of SPW is powerful. Even if one blamed it on the thc as not revealing a subcomponent of brain but as being created by the thc, this doesn't hold much weight as a little inhibition created by hemp - that (such a thing) being able to create something so amazing is not really credible.<br>
<br>
And if it creates one world (SPW) by spheric saccades, I bet it creates the other (CMW) by spheric saccades. The pulses could be rings and the gaps (/precession) could be movement. Then the movement wouldn't get as much clarity, but would still help provide sense of movement for directionality. All that matters with pulse length is that it's inner spike timings be consistent in meaning in what is being drawn. Just as freq doesn't matter except for resolution of how much detail (on/off rate) can be drawn.<br>
<br>
When you say there are 16 or 17 banks, what you mean is there could be just 1 bank, and any of those numerous "banks" is more like "3d skin outline created from selected points in bank/matrix." Is it possible the rings give scaffolding spatial support to masterbank rather than vice versa? And bank is built from nothing but a huge compilation of random patterns of neural firings (linked by fire-together, wire-together) the activation of which ones by rings at given times provides spatial quality of bank because it is the only way to make sense of it. Possibly the fast firing SPW saccades (all traced by rings) help hold space for the bank.<br>
<br>
Could the kick out of ring trace of CMW provide motor qualia and sense of flow of time/story and kick out of ring trace of SPW (never even experienced yet but predicted and assumed reasonable to not have experienced yet due to higher freq of SPW) provide color qualia? Could kick out of SPW be much more spastic and discontinuous and SHORTER DURATION (?) than CMW thus providing instantaneous color feel to any modeled point in SPW along ring? Why does ring trace of CMW leave a cavern and ring trace of SPW leave a puzzle piece stack? Could color be traced by broken glass thus explaining similarity between deep red and deep purple, and skew of yellow towards lighter, and front to back providing light to dark? And sphere is cavern is CMW and cube is puzzle piece is SPW? Of course toe wiggle is incompatible with that unless just extra functionality of bank. <br>
<br>
Altho puzzle pieces had a time flow direction also. And it wasn't spastic as theorized. Unless there's something extra there. Or unless ring/wall vibrations or vibrations thru fast paced small spatial changing of what is defined is color. Sound vibrations definitely seem mapped to the digit writing CMW; perhaps color vibrations are mapped to the digit writing SPW? This would result in two rings tho, unless color vibrations are "baked in" to ring prior to letting CMW wiggle sound and smell.<br>
<br>
I think the flow of "time" in CMW, along with its ability to creatively transition from modeling one idea into modeling another is what gives some "high" times the sense of transitioning from one dimension 90° into anther. <br>
<br>
Just a thot - could it be that body is modeled as a third digit on ring? And that all sixteen "banks" (better: "skin outlines") could be digits on ring? Could even ring shape (from amygdala?) be yet one more digit which is used for memory purposes and then somehow stored or address or shape or something done in hipp?<br>
<br>
Maybe something models up (in SPW and CMW) by default and just by drawing whatever is current at up plane (coronal?) defines it? <br>
<br>
The crazy thing with the brain is that there "has" to be an easy solution or else it would complicate and mess up all the time, yet as much as you dig and theorize, nothing seems super clear cut and almost always (always) has resoundingly big problem(s) to defeat it immediately.<br>
